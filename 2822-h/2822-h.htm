<h2>INTRODUCTION.</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">Don Manoel Gonzales</span> is the assumed
name of the writer of a &ldquo;Voyage to Great Britain,
containing an Account of England and Scotland,&rdquo; which was
first printed in the first of the two folio volumes of &ldquo;A
Collection of Voyages and Travels, compiled from the Library of
the Earl of Oxford&rdquo; (Robert Harley, who died in 1724, but
whose industry in collection was continued by his son Edward, the
second Earl), &ldquo;interspersed and illustrated with
Notes.&rdquo;&nbsp; These volumes, known as the &ldquo;Harleian
Collection,&rdquo; were published in 1745 and 1746.&nbsp; The
narrative was reproduced early in the present century in the
second of the seventeen quartos of John Pinkerton&rsquo;s
&ldquo;General Collection of the best and the most interesting
Voyages and Travels of the World&rdquo; (1808&ndash;1814), from
which this account of London is taken.&nbsp; The writer does
here, no doubt, keep up his character of Portuguese by a light
allusion to &ldquo;our extensive city of Lisbon,&rdquo; but he
forgets to show his nationality when speaking of Portugal among
the countries with which London has trade, and he writes of
London altogether like one to the City born, when he describes
its inner life together with its institutions and its
buildings.</p>
<p>The book is one of those that have been attributed to Defoe,
who died in 1731, and the London it describes was dated by
Pinkerton in the last year of Defoe&rsquo;s life.&nbsp; This is
also the latest date to be found in the narrative.&nbsp; On page
93 of this volume, old buildings at St. Bartholomew&rsquo;s are
said to have been pulled down in the year 1731, &ldquo;and a
magnificent pile erected in the room of them, about 150 feet in
length, faced with a pure white stone, besides other additions
now building.&rdquo;&nbsp; That passage was written, therefore,
after 1731, and could not possibly have been written by
Defoe.&nbsp; But if the book was in Robert Harley&rsquo;s
collection, and not one of the additions made by his son the
second earl, the main body of the account of London must be of a
date earlier than the first earl&rsquo;s death in 1724.&nbsp;
Note, for instance, the references on pages 27, 28, to &ldquo;the
late Queen Mary,&rdquo; and to &ldquo;her Majesty&rdquo; Queen
Anne, as if Anne were living.&nbsp; It would afterwards have been
brought to date of publication by additions made in or before
1745.&nbsp; The writer, whoever he may have been, was an able
man, who joined to the detail of a guide-book the clear
observation of one who writes like an educated and not
untravelled London merchant, giving a description of his native
town as it was in the reign of George the First, with addition of
a later touch or two from the beginning of the reign of George
the Second.</p>
<p>His London is London of the time when Pope published his
translation of the &ldquo;Iliad,&rdquo; and was nettled at the
report that Addison, at Button&rsquo;s Coffee House, had given to
Tickell&rsquo;s little venture in the same direction the praise
of having more in it of Homer&rsquo;s fire.&nbsp; Button&rsquo;s
Coffee House was of Addison&rsquo;s foundation, for the benefit
of Daniel Button, an old steward of the Countess of
Warwick&rsquo;s, whom he had settled there in 1812.&nbsp; It was
in Russell Street, Covent Garden, and Addison brought the wits to
it by using it himself.&nbsp; &ldquo;Don Manoel Gonzales&rdquo;
describes very clearly in the latter part of this account of
London, the manner of using taverns and coffee-houses by the
Londoners of his days, and other ways of life with high and
low.&nbsp; It is noticeable, however, that his glance does not
include the ways of men of letters.&nbsp; His four orders of
society are, the noblemen and gentlemen, whose wives breakfast at
twelve; the merchants and richer tradesmen; after whom he places
the lawyers and doctors; whose professional class is followed by
that of the small tradesmen, costermongers, and other people of
the lower orders.&nbsp; This, and the clearness of detail upon
London commerce, may strengthen the general impression that the
description comes rather from a shrewd, clear-headed, and
successful merchant than from a man of letters.</p>
<p>The London described is that of Addison who died in 1719, of
Steele who died in 1729, of Pope who died in 1744.&nbsp; It is
the London into which Samuel Johnson came in 1738, at the age of
twenty-nine&mdash;seven years before the manuscript of
&ldquo;Manoel de Gonzales&rdquo; appeared in print.&nbsp;
&ldquo;How different a place,&rdquo; said Johnson, &ldquo;London
is to different people; but the intellectual man is struck with
it as comprehending the whole of human life in all its variety,
the contemplation of which is inexhaustible.&rdquo;&nbsp; Its
hard features were shown in the poem entitled
<i>London</i>&mdash;an imitation of the third satire of
Juvenal&mdash;with which Johnson began his career in the great
city, pressed by poverty, but not to be subdued:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;By numbers here from shame or censure
free,<br />
All crimes are safe but hated poverty.<br />
This, only this, the rigid law pursues,<br />
This, only this, provokes the snarling Muse.<br />
The sober trader, at a tattered cloak,<br />
Wakes from his dream and labours for a joke;<br />
With brisker air the silken courtiers gaze,<br />
And turn the varied taunt a thousand ways.<br />
Of all the griefs that harass the distressed,<br />
Sure the most bitter is a scornful jest;<br />
Fate never wounds more deep the generous heart<br />
Than when a blockhead&rsquo;s insult points the dart.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>When Don Manoel&rsquo;s account of London was written the
fashionable world was only beginning to migrate from Covent
Garden&mdash;once a garden belonging to the Convent of
Westminster, and the first London square inhabited by persons of
rank and fashion&mdash;to Grosvenor Square, of which Don Manoel
describes the new glories.&nbsp; They included a gilt equestrian
statue of King George I. in the middle of its garden, to say
nothing of kitchen areas to its houses, then unusual enough to
need special description: &ldquo;To the kitchens and offices,
which have little paved yards with vaults before them, they
descend by twelve or fifteen steps, and these yards are defended
by a high palisade of iron.&rdquo;&nbsp; Altogether, we are told,
Grosvenor Square &ldquo;may well be looked upon as the beauty of
the town, and those who have not seen it cannot have an adequate
idea of the place.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Covent Garden is named by &ldquo;Don Manoel
Gonzales,&rdquo; with St. James&rsquo;s Park, as a
gathering-place of the London world of fashion.&nbsp; The
neighbouring streets, it may be added, had many coffee-houses,
wine-cellars, fruit and jelly shops; fruit, flowers, and herbs
were sold in its central space; and one large woman thoughtfully
considering the fashion of the place, sat at her stall in a lace
dress of which the lowest estimate was that it must have cost a
hundred guineas.</p>

<h2>LONDON IN 1731.</h2>
<p class="gutsumm"><span class="GutSmall">CONTAINING A
DESCRIPTION OF THE CITY OF LONDON; BOTH IN REGARD TO ITS EXTENT,
BUILDINGS, GOVERNMENT, TRADE, ETC.</span></p>
<p><span class="smcap">London</span>, the capital of the kingdom
of England, taken in its largest extent, comprehends the cities
of London and Westminster, with their respective suburbs, and the
borough of Southwark, with the buildings contiguous thereto on
the south side of the river, both on the east and west sides of
the bridge.</p>
<p>The length thereof, if we measure in a direct line from Hyde
Park gate, on the west side of Grosvenor Square, to the farthest
buildings that are contiguous in Limehouse, that is, from west to
east, is very near five miles in a direct line; but if we take in
the turnings and windings of the streets, it cannot be less than
six miles.&nbsp; The breadth in many places from north to south
is about two miles and a half, but in others not above a mile and
a half; the circumference of the whole being about sixteen
miles.</p>
<p>The situation next the river is hilly, and in some places very
steep; but the streets are for the most part upon a level, and
the principal of them nowhere to be paralleled for their length,
breadth, beauty, and regularity of the buildings, any more than
the spacious and magnificent squares with which this city
abounds.</p>
<p>As to the dimensions of the city within the walls, I find that
the late wall on the land side from the Tower in the east, to the
mouth of Fleet Ditch in the west, was two miles wanting ten
poles; and the line along the Thames, where there has been no
walls for many hundred years, if ever, contains from the Tower in
the east, to the mouth of the same ditch in the west, a mile and
forty poles; which added to the circuit of the wall, on the land
side, makes in the whole three miles thirty poles; and as it is
of an irregular figure, narrow at each end, and the broadest part
not half the length of it, the content of the ground within the
walls, upon the most accurate survey, does not contain more than
three hundred and eighty acres; which is not a third part of the
contents of our extensive city of Lisbon: but then this must be
remembered, Lisbon contains a great quantity of arable and waste
ground within its walls, whereas London is one continued pile of
buildings.&nbsp; The city gates are at this day eight, besides
posterns, viz.: 1, Aldgate; 2, Bishopsgate; 3, Moorgate; 4,
Cripplegate; 5, Aldersgate; 6, Newgate; 7, Ludgate; and, 8, The
Bridgegate.</p>
<p>1.&nbsp; Aldgate, or Ealdgate, in the east, is of great
antiquity, even as old as the days of King Edgar, who mentions it
in a charter to the knights of Knighton-Guild.&nbsp; Upon the top
of it, to the eastward, is placed a golden sphere; and on the
upper battlements, the figures of two soldiers as sentinels:
beneath, in a large square, King James I. is represented standing
in gilt armour, at whose feet are a lion and unicorn, both
couchant, the first the supporter of England, and the other for
Scotland.&nbsp; On the west side of the gate is the figure of
Fortune, finely gilded and carved, with a prosperous sail over
her head, standing on a globe, overlooking the city.&nbsp;
Beneath it is the King&rsquo;s arms, with the usual motto,
<i>Dieu et mon droit</i>, and under it, <i>Vivat rex</i>.&nbsp; A
little lower, on one side, is the figure of a woman, being the
emblem of peace, with a dove in one hand, and a gilded wreath or
garland in the other; and on the other side is the figure of
charity, with a child at her breast, and another in her hand; and
over the arch of the gate is this inscription, viz., <i>Senatus
populusque Londinensis fecit</i>, 1609, and under it, Humphrey
Weld, Mayor, in whose mayoralty it was finished.</p>
<p>2.&nbsp; Bishopsgate, which stands north-west of Aldgate, is
supposed to have been built by some bishop about the year
1200.&nbsp; It was afterwards several times repaired by the
merchants of the Hanse Towns, on account of the confirmation of
their privileges in this city.&nbsp; The figures of the two
bishops on the north side are pretty much defaced, as are the
city arms engraven on the south side of it.</p>
<p>3.&nbsp; Aldersgate, the ancient north gate of the city,
stands to the westward of Bishopsgate.&nbsp; On the north, or
outside of it, is the figure of King James I. on horseback, who
entered the city at this gate when he came from Scotland, on his
accession to the throne of England.&nbsp; Over the head of this
figure are the arms of England, Scotland, and Ireland; and on one
side the image of the prophet Jeremy, with this text engraved,
&ldquo;Then shall enter into the gates of this city, kings and
princes sitting on the throne of David, riding on chariots and on
horses, they and their princes, the men of Judah, and the
inhabitants of Jerusalem.&rdquo;&nbsp; And on the other side, the
figure of the prophet Samuel, with the following passage,
&ldquo;And Samuel said unto all Israel, Behold, I have hearkened
unto your voice in all that you have said unto me, and have made
a king over you.&rdquo;&nbsp; On the south, or inside of the
gate, is the effigy of King James I. sitting on his throne in his
robes.</p>
<p>4.&nbsp; Newgate, so called from its being built later than
the other principal gates, is situated on the north-west corner
of the city, said to be erected in the reign of Henry I. or King
Stephen, when the way through Ludgate was interrupted by
enlarging the cathedral of St. Paul&rsquo;s and the churchyard
about it.&nbsp; This gate hath been the county jail for Middlesex
at least five hundred years.&nbsp; The west, or outside of the
gate is adorned with three ranges of pilasters and their
entablements of the Tuscan order.&nbsp; Over the lowest is a
circular pediment, and above it the King&rsquo;s arms.&nbsp; The
inter columns are four niches, and as many figures in them, well
carved, and large as the life.&nbsp; The east, or inside of the
gate, is adorned with a range of pilasters with entablements as
the other, and in three niches are the figures of justice, mercy,
and truth, with this inscription, viz., &ldquo;This part of
Newgate was begun to be repaired in the mayoralty of Sir James
Campel, Knight, anno 1630, and finished in the mayoralty of Sir
Robert Ducie, Bart., anno 1631; and being damnified by the fire
in 1666, it was repaired in the mayoralty of Sir George Waterman,
anno 1672.&rdquo;</p>
<p>5.&nbsp; Ludgate, the ancient western gate of the city, stands
between Newgate and the Thames, built by King Lud about
threescore years before the birth of our Saviour.&nbsp; It was
repaired in the reign of King John, anno 1215, and afterwards in
the year 1260, when it was adorned with the figures of King Lud
and his two sons, Androgeus and Theomantius; but at the
Reformation, in the reign of Edward VI., some zealous people
struck off all their heads, looking upon images of all kinds to
be Popish and idolatrous.&nbsp; In the reign of Queen Mary, new
heads were placed on the bodies of these kings, and so remained
till the 28th of Queen Elizabeth, anno 1586, when the gate, being
very ruinous, was pulled down, and beautifully rebuilt: the east
or inside whereof was adorned with four pilasters and entablature
of the Doric order, and in the intercolumns were placed the
figures of King Lud and his two sons (who are supposed to have
succeeded him) in their British habits again; and above them the
queen&rsquo;s arms, viz., those of France and England quarterly,
the supporters a lion and a dragon.&nbsp; It was afterwards
repaired and beautified, anno 1699, Sir Francis Child lord
mayor.&nbsp; The west or outside of the gate is adorned with two
pilasters and entablature of the Ionic order; also two columns
and a pediment adorning a niche, wherein is placed a good statue
of Queen Elizabeth in her robes and the regalia; and over it the
queen&rsquo;s arms between the city supporters, placed at some
distance.&nbsp; This gate was made a prison for debtors who were
free of the city, anno 1 Richard II., 1378, Nicholas Brember then
mayor, and confirmed such by the mayor and common council, anno
1382, John Northampton mayor.</p>
<p>The Tower of London is situated at the south-east end of the
city, on the river Thames, and consists in reality of a great
number of towers or forts, built at several times, which still
retain their several names, though at present most of them,
together with a little town and church, are enclosed within one
wall and ditch, and compose but one entire fortress.</p>
<p>It was the vulgar opinion that the Tower was built by Julius
C&aelig;sar; but, as I have before shown, history informs us that
C&aelig;sar made no stay in England, that he erected no town or
fortress, unless that with which he enclosed his ships on the
coast of Kent, nor left a single garrison or soldier in the
island on his departure.</p>
<p>This Tower, as now encompassed, stands upon twelve acres of
ground, and something more, being of an irregular form, but
approaching near to that of an oblong, one of the longest sides
lying next the river, from whence it rises gradually towards the
north, by a pretty deep ascent, to the armoury, which stands upon
the highest ground in the Tower, overlooking the White Tower
built by William the Conqueror, and the remains of the castle
below it on the Thames side, said to be built by William
Rufus.</p>
<p>As to the strength of the place, the works being all antique,
would not be able to hold out four-and-twenty hours against an
army prepared for a siege: the ditch indeed is of a great depth,
and upwards of a hundred feet broad, into which the water of the
Thames may be introduced at pleasure; but I question whether the
walls on the inside would bear the firing of their own guns:
certain it is, two or three battering-pieces would soon lay them
even with the ground, though, after all, the ditch alone is
sufficient to defend it against a sudden assault.&nbsp; There are
several small towers upon the walls; those of the largest
dimensions, and which appear the most formidable, are the Divelin
Tower, on the north-west; and the Martin Tower on the north-east;
and St. Thomas&rsquo;s Tower on the river by Traitor&rsquo;s
Bridge; which I take to be part of the castle said to be built by
William Rufus.&nbsp; There is also a large tower on the outside
the ditch, called the Lions&rsquo; Tower, on the south-west
corner, near which is the principal gate and bridge by which
coaches and carriages enter the Tower; and there are two posterns
with bridges over the ditch to the wharf on the Thames side, one
whereof is called Traitor&rsquo;s Bridge, under which state
prisoners used to enter the Tower.</p>
<p>The principal places and buildings within the Tower, are (1)
The parochial church of St. Peter (for the Tower is a parish of
itself, in which are fifty houses and upwards, inhabited by the
governor, deputy-governor, warders, and other officers belonging
to the fortress).</p>
<p>(2) To the eastward of the church stands a noble pile of
building, usually called the armoury, begun by King James II. and
finished by King William III., being three hundred and ninety
feet in length, and sixty in breadth: the stately door-case on
the south side is adorned with four columns, entablature and
triangular pediment, of the Doric order.&nbsp; Under the pediment
are the king&rsquo;s arms, with enrichments of trophy-work, very
ornamental.&nbsp; It consists of two lofty rooms, reaching the
whole length of the building: in the lower room is a complete
train of artillery, consisting of brass cannon and mortars fit to
attend an army of a hundred-thousand men; but none of the cannon
I observe there were above four-and-twenty pounders; the large
battering-pieces, which carry balls of thirty-two and forty-eight
pounds weight, I perceive, are in the king&rsquo;s store-houses
at Deptford, Woolwich, Chatham, and Portsmouth.&nbsp; In the
armoury also we find a great many of the little cohorn mortars,
so called from the Dutch engineer Cohorn, who invented them for
firing a great number of hand-grenades from them at once; with
other extraordinary pieces cast at home, or taken from the
enemy.</p>
<p>In the room over the artillery is the armoury of small arms,
of equal dimensions with that underneath, in which are placed, in
admirable order, muskets and other small arms for fourscore
thousand men, most of them of the newest make, having the best
locks, barrels, and stocks, that can be contrived for service;
neither the locks or barrels indeed are wrought, but I look upon
them to be the more durable and serviceable, and much easier
cleaned.&nbsp; There are abundance of hands always employed in
keeping them bright, and they are so artfully laid up, that any
one piece may be taken down without moving another.&nbsp; Besides
these, which with pilasters of pikes furnish all the middle of
the room from top to bottom, leaving only a walk through the
middle, and another on each side, the north and south walls of
the armoury are each of them adorned with eight pilasters of
pikes and pistols of the Corinthian order, whose intercolumns are
chequer-work of carbines and pistols; waves of the sea in
cutlasses, swords, and bayonets; half moons, semicircles, and a
target of bayonets; the form of a battery in swords and pistols;
suns, with circles of pistols; a pair of gates in halberts and
pistols; the Witch of Endor, as it is called, within three
ellipses of pistols; the backbone of a whale in carbines; a fiery
serpent, Jupiter and the Hydra, in bayonets, &amp;c.&nbsp; But
nothing looks more beautiful and magnificent than the four lofty
wreathed columns formed with pistols in the middle of the room,
which seem to support it.&nbsp; They show us also some other
arms, which are only remarkable for the use they have been put
to; as the two swords of state, carried before the Pretender when
he invaded Scotland in the year 1715; and the arms taken from the
Spaniards who landed in Scotland in the year 1719, &amp;c.</p>
<p>The small arms were placed in this beautiful order by one Mr.
Harris, originally a blacksmith, who was properly the forger of
his own fortune, having raised himself by his merit: he had a
place or pension granted him by the government for this piece of
service in particular, which he richly deserved, no nation in
Europe being able to show a magazine of small arms so good in
their kind, and so ingeniously disposed.&nbsp; In the place where
the armoury now stands was formerly a bowling-green, a garden,
and some buildings, which were demolished to make room for the
grand arsenal I have been describing.</p>
<p>In the horse-armoury the most remarkable things are some of
the English kings on horseback in complete armour, among which
the chief are Edward III., Henrys V. and VII., King Charles I.
and II., and King William, and a suit of silver armour, said to
belong to John of Gaunt, seven feet and a half high.&nbsp; Here
also they show us the armour of the Lord Kingsale, with the sword
he took from the French general, which gained him the privilege
of being covered in the king&rsquo;s presence, which his
posterity enjoy to this day.</p>
<p>The office of ordnance is in the Tower, with the several
apartments of the officers that belong to it, who have the
direction of all the arms, ammunition, artillery, magazines, and
stores of war in the kingdom.</p>
<p>The White Tower is a lofty, square stone building, with a
turret at each angle, standing on the declivity of the hill, a
little below the armoury, and disengaged from the other
buildings, where some thousand barrels of powder were formerly
kept; but great part of the public magazine of powder is now
distributed in the several yards and storehouses belonging to the
government, as at Woolwich, Chatham, Portsmouth, Plymouth,
&amp;c., to prevent accidents, I presume; for should such a
prodigious quantity of powder take fire, it must be of fatal
consequence to the city, as well as the Tower.&nbsp; The main
guard of the Tower, with the lodgings of the officers, are on the
east side of this building.</p>
<p>In the chapel of the White Tower, usually called
C&aelig;sar&rsquo;s Chapel, and in a large room adjoining on the
east side thereof, sixty-four feet long, and thirty-one broad,
are kept many ancient records, such as privy-seals in several
reigns, bills, answers, and depositions in chancery, in the
reigns of Queen Elizabeth, King James I., and King Charles I.,
writs of <i>distringas</i>, <i>supersedeas</i>, <i>de
excommunicato capiendo</i>, and other writs relating to the
courts of law; but the records of the greatest importance are
lodged in the Tower called Wakefield Tower, consisting of statute
rolls from the 6th of Edward I. to the 8th of Edward III.</p>
<p>Parliament rolls beginning anno 5 of Edward II. and ending
with the reign of Edward IV.</p>
<p>Patent rolls beginning anno 3 of John, and ending with the
reign of Edward IV.&nbsp; In these are contained grants of
offices, hands, tenements, temporalities, &amp;c., passing under
the great seal.</p>
<p>Charter rolls, from the 1st of King John to the end of Edward
IV. in which are enrolments of grants, and confirmations of
liberties and privileges to cities and towns corporate, and to
private persons, as markets, fairs, free warren, common of
pasture, waifs, strays, felons&rsquo; goods, &amp;c.</p>
<p>The foundations of abbeys and priories, of colleges and
schools, together with lands and privileges granted to them.</p>
<p>The patents of creation of noblemen.</p>
<p>Close rolls, from the 6th of King John, to the end of Edward
IV., in which are writs of various kinds, but more especially on
the back of the roll are entered the writs of summons to
parliament, both to the lords and commons, and of the bishops and
inferior clergy to convocations.&nbsp; There are also
proclamations, and enrolments of deeds between party and
party.</p>
<p>French rolls, beginning anno 1 of Edward II. and ending with
Edward IV., in which are leagues and treaties with the kings of
France, and other matters relating to that kingdom.</p>
<p>Scotch rolls, containing transactions with that kingdom.</p>
<p>Rome, touching the affairs of that see.</p>
<p>Vascon rolls, relating to Gascoign.</p>
<p>There are also other rolls and records of different
natures.</p>
<p>In this tower are also kept the inquisitions <i>post
mortem</i>, from the first year of King Henry III., to the third
year of Richard III.</p>
<p>The inquisitions <i>ad quod damnum</i>, from the first of
Edward II. to the end of Henry V.</p>
<p>Writs of summons, and returns to Parliament, from the reign of
Edward I. to the 17th of Edward IV.</p>
<p>Popes&rsquo; bulls, and original letters from foreign
princes.</p>
<p>All which were put into order, and secured in excellent
wainscot presses, by order of the house of peers, in the year
1719 and 1720.&nbsp; Attendance is given at this office, and
searches may be made from seven o&rsquo;clock in the morning to
eleven, and from one to five in the afternoon, unless in
December, January, and February, when the office is open only
from eight to eleven in the morning, and from one to four, except
holidays.</p>
<p>The next office I shall mention is the Mint, where, at
present, all the money in the kingdom is coined.&nbsp; This makes
a considerable street in the Tower, wherein are apartments for
the officers belonging to it.&nbsp; The principal officers
are:&mdash;l. The warden, who receives the gold and silver
bullion, and pays the full value for it, the charge being
defrayed by a small duty on wines.&nbsp; 2. The master and
worker, who takes the bullion from the warden, causes it to be
melted, delivers it to the moneyers, and when it is minted
receives it from them again.&nbsp; 3. The comptroller, who sees
that the money be made according to the just assize, overlooks
the officers and controls them.&nbsp; 4. The assay-master, who
sees that the money be according to the standard of
fineness.&nbsp; 5. The auditor, who takes the accounts, and makes
them up.&nbsp; 6.&nbsp; The surveyor-general, who takes care that
the fineness be not altered in the melting.&nbsp; And, 7, the
weigher and teller.</p>
<p>The Jewel-office, where the regalia are reposited, stands near
the east end of the Armoury.&nbsp; A list is usually given to
those who come daily to see these curiosities in the Jewel-house,
a copy whereof follows, viz.:</p>
<p style="text-align: center" class="gutindent"><i>A list of his
Majesty&rsquo;s regalia</i>, <i>besides plate</i>, <i>and other
rich things</i>, <i>at the Jewel-house in the Tower of
London</i>.</p>
<p class="gutindent">1.&nbsp; The imperial crown, which all the
kings of England have been crowned with, ever since Edward the
Confessor&rsquo;s time.</p>
<p class="gutindent">2.&nbsp; The orb, or globe, held in the
king&rsquo;s left hand at the coronation; on the top of which is
a jewel near an inch and half in height.</p>
<p class="gutindent">3.&nbsp; The royal sceptre with the cross,
which has another jewel of great value under it.</p>
<p class="gutindent">4.&nbsp; The sceptre with the dove, being
the emblem of peace.</p>
<p class="gutindent">5.&nbsp; St. Edward&rsquo;s staff, all
beaten gold, carried before the king at the coronation.</p>
<p class="gutindent">6.&nbsp; A rich salt-cellar of state, the
figure of the Tower, used on the king&rsquo;s table at the
coronation.</p>
<p class="gutindent">7.&nbsp; Curtana, or the sword of mercy,
borne between the two swords of justice, the spiritual and
temporal, at the coronation.</p>
<p class="gutindent">8.&nbsp; A noble silver font, double gilt,
that the kings and royal family were christened in.</p>
<p class="gutindent">9.&nbsp; A large silver fountain, presented
to King Charles II. by the town of Plymouth.</p>
<p class="gutindent">10.&nbsp; Queen Anne&rsquo;s diadem, or
circlet which her majesty wore in proceeding to her
coronation.</p>
<p class="gutindent">11.&nbsp; The coronation crown made for the
late Queen Mary.</p>
<p class="gutindent">12.&nbsp; The rich crown of state that his
majesty wears on his throne in parliament, in which is a large
emerald seven inches round, a pearl the finest in the world, and
a ruby of inestimable value.</p>
<p class="gutindent">13.&nbsp; A globe and sceptre made for the
late Queen Mary.</p>
<p class="gutindent">14.&nbsp; An ivory sceptre with a dove, made
for the late King James&rsquo;s queen.</p>
<p class="gutindent">15.&nbsp; The golden spurs and the
<i>armillas</i> that are worn at the coronation.</p>
<p>There is also an apartment in the Tower where noble prisoners
used to be confined, but of late years some of less quality have
been sent thither.</p>
<p>The Tower where the lions and other savage animals are kept is
on the right hand, on the outside the ditch, as we enter the
fortress.&nbsp; These consist of lions, leopards, tigers, eagles,
vultures, and such other wild creatures as foreign princes or
sea-officers have presented to the British kings and queens.</p>
<p>Not far from the Tower stands London Bridge.&nbsp; This bridge
has nineteen arches besides the drawbridge, and is built with
hewn stone, being one thousand two hundred feet in length, and
seventy-four in breadth, whereof the houses built on each side
take up twenty-seven feet, and the street between the houses
twenty feet; there being only three vacancies about the middle of
the bridge where there are no houses, but a low stone wall, with
an iron palisade, through which is a fine view of the shipping
and vessels in the river.&nbsp; This street over the bridge is as
much thronged, and has as brisk a trade as any street in the
city; and the perpetual passage of coaches and carriages makes it
troublesome walking on it, there being no posts to keep off
carriages as in other streets.&nbsp; The middle vacancy was left
for a drawbridge, which used formerly to be drawn up when
shipping passed that way; but no vessels come above the bridge at
this day but such as can strike their masts, and pass under the
arches.&nbsp; Four of the arches on the north side of the bridge
are now taken up with mills and engines, that raise the water to
a great height, for the supply of the city; this brings in a
large revenue which, with the rents of the houses on the bridge,
and other houses and lands that belong to it, are applied as far
as is necessary to the repair of it by the officers appointed for
that service, who are, a comptroller and two bridge-masters, with
their subordinate officers; and in some years, it is said, not
less than three thousand pounds are laid out in repairing and
supporting this mighty fabric, though it be never suffered to run
much to decay.</p>
<p>I come next to describe that circuit of ground which lies
without the walls, but within the freedom and jurisdiction of the
City of London.&nbsp; And this is bounded by a line which begins
at Temple Bar, and extends itself by many turnings and windings
through part of Shear Lane, Bell Yard, Chancery Lane, by the
Rolls Liberty, &amp;c., into Holborn, almost against
Gray&rsquo;s-Inn Lane, where there is a bar (consisting of posts,
rails, and a chain) usually called Holborn Bars; from whence it
passes with many turnings and windings by the south end of Brook
Street, Furnival&rsquo;s Inn, Leather Lane, the south end of
Hatton Garden, Ely House, Field Lane, and Chick Lane, to the
common sewer; then to Cow Cross, and so to Smithfield Bars; from
whence it runs with several windings between Long Lane and
Charterhouse Lane to Goswell Street, and so up that street
northward to the Bars.</p>
<p>From these Bars in Goswell Street, where the manor of Finsbury
begins, the line extends by Golden Lane to the posts and chain in
Whitecross Street, and from thence to the posts and chain in Grub
Street; and then runs through Ropemakers Alley to the posts and
chain in the highway from Moorgate, and from thence by the north
side of Moorfields; after which it runs northwards to
Nortonfalgate, meeting with the bars in Bishopsgate Street, and
from thence runs eastward into Spittlefields, abutting all along
upon Nortonfalgate.</p>
<p>From Nortonfalgate it returns southwards by Spittlefields, and
then south-east by Wentworth Street, to the bars in
Whitechapel.&nbsp; From hence it inclines more southerly to the
Little Minories and Goodman&rsquo;s Fields: from whence it
returns westward to the posts and chain in the Minories, and so
on more westerly till it comes to London Wall, abutting on the
Tower Liberty, and there it ends.&nbsp; The ground comprehended
betwixt this line and the city wall contains about three hundred
acres.</p>
<p>There is no wall or fence, as has been hinted already, to
separate the freedom of the City from that part of the town which
lies in the county of Middlesex, only posts and chains at certain
places, and one gate at the west end of Fleet Street which goes
by the name of Temple Bar.</p>
<p>This gate resembles a triumphal arch; it is built of hewn
stone, each side being adorned with four pilasters, their
entablature, and an arched pediment of the Corinthian
order.&nbsp; The intercolumns are niches replenished; those
within the Bar towards the east, with the figures of King James
I. and his queen; and those without the Bar, with the figures of
King Charles I. and King Charles II.&nbsp; It is encircled also
with cornucopias, and has two large cartouches by way of
supporters to the whole; and on the inside of the gate is the
following inscription, viz., &ldquo;Erected in the year 1671, Sir
Samuel Starling, Mayor: continued in the year 1670, Sir Richard
Ford, Lord Mayor: and finished in the year 1672, Sir George
Waterman, Lord Mayor.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The city is divided into twenty-six wards or governments, each
having its peculiar officers, as alderman, common council,
&amp;c.&nbsp; But all are subject to the lord mayor, the supreme
magistrate of this great metropolis.&nbsp; Of each of these wards
take the following account.</p>
<p>1.&nbsp; Portsoken ward is situate without Aldgate, the most
easterly ward belonging to the City; and extends from Aldgate
eastward to the bars.&nbsp; The chief streets and places
comprehended in it, are part of Whitechapel Street, the Minories,
Houndsditch, and the west side of Petticoat Lane.</p>
<p>Whitechapel is a handsome broad street, by which we enter the
town from the east.&nbsp; The south side, or great part of it, is
taken up by butchers who deal in the wholesale way, selling whole
carcases of veal, mutton, and lamb (which come chiefly out of
Essex) to the town butchers.&nbsp; On the north side are a great
many good inns, and several considerable tradesmen&rsquo;s
houses, who serve the east part of England with such goods and
merchandise as London affords.&nbsp; On the south side is a great
market for hay three times a week.</p>
<p>Tower ward extends along the Thames from the Tower on the east
almost to Billingsgate on the west, and that part of the Tower
itself which lies to the westward of the White Tower is held by
some to be within this ward.&nbsp; The principal streets and
places contained in it are Great Tower Street, part of Little
Tower Street and Tower Hill, part of Thames Street, Mark Lane,
Mincing Lane, Seething Lane, St. Olave Hart Street, Idle Lane,
St. Dunstan&rsquo;s Hill, Harp Lane, Water Lane, and Bear Lane,
with the courts and alleys that fall into them.</p>
<p>Great Tower Hill lies on the outside of the Tower Ditch
towards the north-west.</p>
<p>Upon this hill is a scaffold erected, at the charge of the
City, for the execution of noble offenders imprisoned in the
Tower (after sentence passed upon them).</p>
<p>The names of the quays or wharves lying on the Thames side in
this ward between the Tower and Billingsgate, are Brewer&rsquo;s
Quay, Chester Quay, Galley Quay, Wool Quay, Porter&rsquo;s Quay,
Custom-House Quay, Great Bear Quay, Little Bear Quay,
Wigging&rsquo;s Quay, Ralph&rsquo;s Quay, Little Dice Quay, Great
Dice Quay, and Smart&rsquo;s Quay, of which, next to the
Custom-House Quay, Bear Quays are the most considerable, there
being one of the greatest markets in England for wheat and other
kinds of grain, brought hither by coasting vessels.</p>
<p>The public buildings in this ward (besides the western part of
the Tower above-mentioned to be within the City) are the Custom
House, Cloth-workers&rsquo; Hall, Bakers&rsquo; Hall, and the
three parish churches of Allhallows Barking, St. Olave Hart
Street, and St. Dunstan&rsquo;s in the East.</p>
<p>The Custom House is situated on the north side of the Thames,
between the Tower and Billingsgate, consisting of two floors, in
the uppermost of which, in a wainscoted magnificent room, almost
the whole length of the building, and fifteen feet in height, sit
the commissioners of the customs, with their under officers and
clerks.&nbsp; The length of this edifice is a hundred and
eighty-nine feet, and the general breadth twenty-seven, but at
the west end it is sixty feet broad.&nbsp; It is built of brick
and stone, and covered with lead, being adorned with the upper
and lower orders of architecture.</p>
<p>3.&nbsp; Aldgate, or Ealdgate Ward.&nbsp; The principal
streets and places in it are Aldgate Street, Berry Street, part
of St. Mary Axe, part of Leadenhall Street, part of Lime Street,
Billiter Lane and Square, part of Mark Lane, Fenchurch Street,
and Crutchedfriars.</p>
<p>The public buildings in this ward are the African House, the
Navy Office, Bricklayers&rsquo; Hall, the churches of St.
Catherine Creechurch, St. James&rsquo;s, Duke&rsquo;s Place, St.
Andrew Undershaft, St. Catherine Coleman, and the Jews&rsquo;
Synagogues.</p>
<p>The Royal African House is situated on the south side of
Leadenhall Street, near the east end of it.&nbsp; Here the
affairs of the company are transacted; but the house has nothing
in it that merits a particular description.</p>
<p>The Navy Office is situated on the south side of
Crutchedfriars, near Tower Hill, being a large, well-built pile
of buildings, and the offices for every branch of business
relating to the navy admirably well disposed.</p>
<p>The Jews&rsquo; synagogues are in Duke&rsquo;s Place, where,
and in that neighbourhood, many of that religion inhabit.&nbsp;
The synagogue stands east and West, as Christian churches usually
do: the great door is on the west, within which is a long desk
upon an ascent, raised above the floor, from whence the law is
read.&nbsp; The east part of the synagogue also is railed in, and
the places where the women sit enclosed with lattices; the men
sit on benches with backs to them, running east and west; and
there are abundance of fine branches for candles, besides lamps,
especially in that belonging to the Portuguese.</p>
<p>4.&nbsp; Lime Street Ward.&nbsp; The principal streets and
places in it are part of Leadenhall Street, and Leadenhall
Market, part of Lime Street, and part of St. Mary Axe.</p>
<p>Leadenhall Market, the finest shambles in Europe, lies between
Leadenhall Street and Fenchurch Street.&nbsp; Of the three courts
or yards which it consists of, the first is that at the
north-east corner of Gracechurch Street, and opens into
Leadenhall Street.&nbsp; This court or yard contains in length
from north to south 164 feet, and in breadth from east to west
eighty feet: within this court or yard, round about the same, are
about 100 standing stalls for butchers, for the selling of beef
only, and therefore this court is called the beef market.&nbsp;
These stalls are either under warehouses, or sheltered from the
weather by roofs over them.&nbsp; This yard is on Tuesdays a
market for leather, to which the tanners resort; on Thursdays the
waggons from Colchester, and other parts, come with baize,
&amp;c., and the fellmongers with their wool; and on Fridays it
is a market for raw hides; on Saturdays, for beef and other
provisions.</p>
<p>The second market yard is called the Greenyard, as being once
a green plot of ground; afterwards it was the City&rsquo;s
storeyard for materials for building and the like; but now a
market only for veal, mutton, lamb, &amp;c.&nbsp; This yard is
170 feet in length from east to west, and ninety feet broad from
north to south; it hath in it 140 stalls for the butchers, all
covered over.&nbsp; In the middle of this Greenyard market from
north to south is a row of shops, with rooms over them, for
fishmongers: and on the south side and west end are houses and
shops also for fishmongers.&nbsp; Towards the east end of this
yard is erected a fair market-house, standing upon columns, with
vaults underneath, and rooms above, with a bell tower, and a
clock, and under it are butchers&rsquo; stalls.&nbsp; The
tenements round about this yard are for the most part inhabited
by cooks and victuallers; and in the passages leading out of the
streets into this market are fishmongers, poulterers,
cheesemongers, and other traders in provisions.</p>
<p>The third market belonging to Leadenhall is called the Herb
Market, for that herbs, roots, fruits, &amp;c., are only there
sold.&nbsp; This market is about 140 feet square; the west, east,
and north sides had walks round them, covered over for shelter,
and standing upon columns; in which walks there were twenty-eight
stalls for gardeners, with cellars under them.</p>
<p>The public buildings in this ward are Leadenhall, the East
India House, Pewterers&rsquo; Hall, and Fletchers&rsquo;
Hall.</p>
<p>Leadenhall is situated on the south side of Leadenhall
Street.&nbsp; It is a large stone fabric, consisting of three
large courts or yards, as has been observed already; part of it
is at present a warehouse, in the occupation of the East India
Company, where the finest calicoes, and other curiosities of the
Eastern part of the world, are reposited; another part of it is
for Colchester baize, and is open every Thursday and
Friday.&nbsp; Here was also anciently a chapel, and a fraternity
of sixty priests constituted to celebrate Divine Service every
day to the market people; but was dissolved with other religious
societies at the Reformation.</p>
<p>On the south side of Leadenhall Street also, and a little to
the eastward of Leadenhall, stands the East India House, lately
magnificently built, with a stone front to the street; but the
front being very narrow, does not make an appearance answerable
to the grandeur of the house within, which stands upon a great
deal of ground, the offices and storehouses admirably well
contrived, and the public hall and the committee room scarce
inferior to anything of the like nature in the City.</p>
<p>There is not one church in this ward at present.&nbsp; The
officers of the ward are, an alderman, his deputy, four
common-council men, four constables, two scavengers, sixteen for
the wardmote inquest, and a beadle.</p>
<p>5.&nbsp; Bishopsgate Ward is divided into two parts, one
within Bishopsgate, and the other without.</p>
<p>The streets and places in this ward, within the gate, are, all
Bishopsgate Street, part of Gracechurch Street, all Great and
Little St. Helen&rsquo;s, all Crosby Square, all Camomile Street,
and a small part of Wormwood Street, with several courts and
alleys that fall into them.</p>
<p>That part of this ward that lies without Bishopsgate extends
northwards as far as the bars, being the bounds of the City
freedom on this side.</p>
<p>The principal streets and places in this ward, without the
gate, are, Bishopsgate Street, Petty France, Bethlem Court and
Lane, and Devonshire Square; besides which, there are little
courts and alleys without number between Bishopsgate Street and
Moorfields.</p>
<p>The public buildings in this ward are Leather-sellers&rsquo;
Hall, Gresham College, the churches of St. Botolph, Bishopsgate,
St. Ethelburga, and St. Helen.</p>
<p>London Workhouse, for the poor of the City of London, also
stands in this ward, just without Bishopsgate, being a long brick
edifice four hundred feet in length, consisting of several
work-rooms and lodging rooms for the vagrants and parish children
brought thither, who are employed in spinning wool and flax, in
sewing, knitting, or winding silk, or making their clothes or
shoes, and are taught to write, read, and cast accounts.&nbsp;
The grown vagrants brought here for a time only are employed in
washing, beating hemp, and picking oakum, and have no more to
keep them than they earn, unless they are sick; and the boys are
put out apprentices to seafaring men or artificers, at a certain
age, and in the meantime have their diet, clothes, physic, and
other necessaries provided for them by the house, which is
supported by private charities, by sums raised annually by the
City, or by the labour of the children, which last article
produces seven or eight hundred pounds per annum.</p>
<p>6.&nbsp; Broad Street Ward contains part of Threadneedle
Street, Bartholomew Lane, part of Prince&rsquo;s Street, part of
Lothbury, part of Throgmorton Street, great part of Broad Street,
Winchester Street, Austinfriars, part of Wormwood Street, and
part of London Wall Street, with the courts and lanes running
into them.</p>
<p>The public buildings in this ward are Carpenters&rsquo; Hall,
Drapers&rsquo; Hall, Merchant Taylors&rsquo; Hall, the South Sea
House, the Pay Office, Allhallows on the Wall, St. Peter&rsquo;s
Poor, the Dutch Church, St. Martin&rsquo;s, St. Bennet&rsquo;s,
St. Bartholomew&rsquo;s, St. Christopher&rsquo;s, and the French
Church.</p>
<p>The most magnificent and beautiful edifice of the kind in this
ward, and indeed in the City of London, is the South Sea House,
lately erected at the north-east corner of Threadneedle Street,
near Bishopsgate Street, and over against the church of St.
Martin Outwich.&nbsp; It is built of stone and brick.</p>
<p>The several offices for transacting the business of this great
company are admirably well disposed; and the great hall for sales
is nowhere to be paralleled, either in its dimensions or
ornaments, any more than the dining-room, galleries, and chambers
above.</p>
<p>7.&nbsp; Cornhill Ward comprehends little more than the street
of the same name, and some little lanes and alleys that fall into
it, as Castle Alley, Sweeting&rsquo;s or Swithin&rsquo;s Alley,
Freeman&rsquo;s Yard, part of Finch Lane, Weigh House Yard, Star
Court, the north end of Birching Lane, St. Michael&rsquo;s Alley,
Pope&rsquo;s Head Alley, and Exchange Alley.</p>
<p>Cornhill Street may, in many respects, be looked upon as the
principal street of the City of London; for here almost all
affairs relating to navigation and commerce are transacted; and
here all the business relating to the great companies and the
Bank are negotiated.&nbsp; This street also is situated near the
centre of the City, and some say, upon the highest ground in
it.&nbsp; It is spacious, and well built with lofty houses, four
or five storeys high, inhabited by linendrapers and other
considerable tradesmen, who deal by wholesale as well as retail,
and adorned with the principal gate and front of the Royal
Exchange.&nbsp; Here also it is said the metropolitan church was
situated, when London was an archbishopric.</p>
<p>Exchange Alley, so denominated from its being situated on the
south side of this street, over against the Royal Exchange, has
long been famous for the great concourse of merchants and
commanders of ships, and the bargains and contracts made there
and in the two celebrated coffee-houses in it, which go under the
respective names of &ldquo;Jonathan&rsquo;s&rdquo; and
&ldquo;Garraway&rsquo;s,&rdquo; where land, stocks, debentures,
and merchandise, and everything that has an existence in Nature,
is bought, sold, and transferred from one to another; and many
things contracted for, that subsists only in the imagination of
the parties.</p>
<p>The public buildings in this ward are, the Royal Exchange, and
the churches of St. Peter and St. Michael.</p>
<p>The Royal Exchange is situated on the north side of Cornhill,
about the middle of the street, forming an oblong open square,
the inside whereof is a hundred and forty-four feet in length
from east to west, and a hundred and seventeen in breadth from
north to south; the area sixty-one square poles, on every side
whereof is a noble piazza or cloister, consisting of twenty-eight
columns and arches that support the galleries above.</p>
<p>The length of the building on the outside is two hundred and
three feet, the breadth a hundred and seventy-one, and the height
fifty-six.&nbsp; On the front towards Cornhill also is a noble
piazza, consisting of ten pillars; and another on the opposite
side next Threadneedle Street, of as many; and in the middle of
each a magnificent gate.&nbsp; Over the Cornhill gate is a
beautiful tower, a hundred and seventy-eight feet high, furnished
with twelve small bells for chimes; and underneath the piazzas
are capacious cellars, which serve for warehouses.</p>
<p>The whole building is of Portland stone, rustic work; above
the arches the inward piazza is an entablament, with fine
enrichments; and on the cornice a range of pilasters, within
entablature, and a spacious compass pediment in the middle of the
corners of each of the four sides.&nbsp; Under the pediment on
the north side are the king&rsquo;s arms; on the south those of
the City; and on the east the arms of Sir Thomas Gresham.&nbsp;
And under the pediment on the west side the arms of the Company
of Mercers, with their respective enrichments.&nbsp; The
intercolumns of the upper range are twenty-four niches, nineteen
of which are filled with the statues of the kings and queens
regent of England, standing erect with their robes and regalia,
except that of King James II. and King George II., which are
habited like the C&aelig;sars.</p>
<p>On the south side are seven niches, of which four are filled,
viz.:&mdash;</p>
<p>1.&nbsp; The most easterly figure, which has this inscription
in gold letters, <i>Edvardus Primus Rex</i>, <i>Anno Dom.</i>
1272.&nbsp; 2.&nbsp; Westward, <i>Edvardus III. Rex</i>, <i>Anno
Dom.</i> 1329.&nbsp; 3.&nbsp; <i>Henricus V. Rex</i>, <i>Anno
Domini</i> 1412.&nbsp; 4.&nbsp; <i>Henricus VI. Rex</i>, <i>Anno
Domini</i> 1422.</p>
<p>On the west side five niches, four of which are filled,
viz.:&mdash;</p>
<p>1.&nbsp; Under the most southerly figures is subscribed in
gold letters, <i>Edvardus IV. Rex</i>, <i>Anno Domini</i>
1460.&nbsp; 2. Northward (the crown pendent over his head)
<i>Edvardus V. Rex</i>, <i>Anno Domini</i> 1483.&nbsp; 3.
<i>Henricus VII. Rex</i>, <i>Anno Domini</i> 1487.&nbsp; 4.
<i>Henricus VIII. Rex</i>, <i>Anno Domini</i> 1508.</p>
<p>On the north side seven niches are filled, viz.:&mdash;</p>
<p>1.&nbsp; The most westerly, subscribed in golden characters,
<i>Edvardus VI. Rex</i>, <i>Anno Domini</i> 1547.&nbsp; 2.&nbsp;
<i>Maria Regina</i>, <i>Anno Domini</i> 1553.&nbsp; 3.
<i>Elizabetha Regina</i>, <i>Anno Domini</i> 1558.&nbsp; 4. Is
subscribed <i>Serenissim &amp; Potentissim&rsquo; Princip&rsquo;

<p>On the four sides of the piazza within the Exchange are
twenty-eight niches, which are all vacant yet, except one near
the north-west angle, where is the figure of Sir Thomas
Gresham.&nbsp; The piazza itself is paved with black and white
marble, and the court, or area, pitched with pebbles; in the
middle whereof is the statue of King Charles II. in a Roman
habit, with a battoon in his hand, erected on a marble pedestal,
about eight feet high and looking southward; on which side of the
pedestal, under an imperial crown, wings, trumpet of fame,
sceptre and sword, palm branches, &amp;c., are these words
inscribed, viz.:&mdash;</p>

<p>On the west side of the pedestal is neatly cut in relievo the
figure of a Cupid reposing his right hand on a shield containing
the arms of England and France quartered, and in his left hand a
rose.</p>
<p>On the north side are the arms of Ireland on a shield,
supported by a Cupid.</p>
<p>On the east side the arms of Scotland, with a Cupid holding a
thistle all in relievo.</p>
<p>The inner piazza and court are divided into several stations,
or walks, where the merchants of the respective nations, and
those who have business with them, assemble distinctly; so that
any merchant or commander of a vessel is readily found, if it be
known to what country he trades.&nbsp; The several walks are
described in the following ground-plot of the
Exchange:&mdash;</p>

<p>Near the south gate is a spacious staircase, and near the
north gate another, that lead up to the galleries, on each side
whereof are shops for milliners and other trades, to the number
of near two hundred, which brought in a good revenue at first,
nothing being thought fashionable that was not purchased there;
but the milliners are now dispersed all over the town, and the
shops in the Exchange almost deserted.</p>

letter 8d., and an ounce 1s. 4d.</p>
<p>9.&nbsp; Billingsgate Ward is bounded by Langbourn Ward
towards the north, by Tower Street Ward on the east, by the River
Thames on the south, and by Bridge Ward Within on the west.&nbsp;
The principal streets and places in this ward are, Thames Street,
Little East Cheap, Pudding Lane, Botolph Lane, Love Lane, St.
Mary Hill, and Rood Lane.</p>
<p>The wharves, or quays, as they lie on the Thames side from
east to west, are, Smart&rsquo;s Quay, Billings gate, Little
Somer&rsquo;s Quay, Great Somer&rsquo;s Quay, Botolph Wharf,
Cox&rsquo;s Quay, and Fresh Wharf which last is the next quay to
the bridge; of which Billingsgate is much the most resorted
to.&nbsp; It is a kind of square dock, or inlet, having quays on
three sides of it, to which the vessels lie close while they are
unloading.&nbsp; By a statute of the 10th and 11th of William
III. it was enacted, &ldquo;That Billingsgate should be a free
market for fish every day in the week, except Sundays.&nbsp; That
a fishing-vessel should pay no other toll or duty than the Act
prescribes, viz., every salt-fish vessel, for groundage, 8d. per
day, and 20d. per voyage; a lobster boat 2d. per day groundage,
and 13d. the voyage; every dogger boat, or smack with sea-fish,
2d. per day groundage, and 13d. the voyage; every oyster vessel,
2d. per day groundage, and a halfpenny per bushel metage.&nbsp;
And that it should be lawful for any person who should buy fish
in the said market to sell the same in any other market or place
in London, or elsewhere, by retail.&rdquo;&nbsp; And because the
fishmongers used to buy up great part of the fish at
Billingsgate, and then divide the same among themselves, in order
to set an extravagant price upon them, it was enacted,
&ldquo;That no person should buy, or cause to be bought, in the
said market of Billingsgate, any quantity of fish, to be divided
by lot among the fishmongers, or other persons, with an intent to
sell them afterwards by retail; and that no fishmonger should buy
any more than for his own use, on pain of &pound;20.&rdquo;&nbsp;
And by the 6th <i>Ann&aelig;</i> it was enacted, &ldquo;That no
person should buy fish at Billingsgate to sell again in the same
market; and that none but fishermen, their wives, or servants,
should sell fish by retail at Billingsgate; and that none should
buy or sell fish there before the ringing of the market
bell.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The public buildings in this ward are Butchers&rsquo; Hall,

legislative authority, in memory of the Fire, anno 1666, and was
designed by Sir Christopher Wren.&nbsp; It has a fluted column,
202 feet high from the ground; the greatest diameter of the shaft
15 feet, and the plinth, or lowest part of the pedestal, 28 feet
square, and 40 feet high; the whole being of Portland stone,
except the staircase within, which is of black marble, containing
345 steps, ten inches and a half broad, and six inches deep; and
a balcony on the outside 32 feet from the top, on which is a
gilded flame.&nbsp; The front of the pedestal, towards the west,
contains a representation of the Fire, and the resurrection of
the present city out of the ruins of the former.</p>
<p>11.&nbsp; Candlewick or Cannon Street Ward contains part of
Great East Cheap, part of Candlewick, now called Cannon Street,
part of Abchurch Lane, St. Nicholas Lane, St. Clement&rsquo;s
Lane, St. Michael&rsquo;s Lane, Crooked Lane, St. Martin&rsquo;s
Lane, St. Lawrence Poultney Lane, with the courts and alleys that
fall into them.</p>
<p>In Cannon Street is that remarkable stone called London Stone,
which has remained fixed in the ground many hundred years, but
for what end is uncertain, though supposed by some to be the
place from whence the Romans began to compute the number of miles
anciently to any part of the kingdom.</p>

part of Bucklersbury, the east end of Budge Row, the north end of
Dowgate, part of Cannon Street, most of Swithin&rsquo;s Lane,

Cornhill and Lombard Street on the north-east, the Poultry on the
north-west, and Walbrook on the south-east.&nbsp; Before the Fire
it was a market chiefly for fish and flesh, and afterwards for
fruit and garden stuff.</p>
<p>In this market Sir Robert Vyner, Bart. and Alderman, erected a
marble equestrian statue of King Charles II., standing on a
pedestal eighteen feet high, and trampling on his enemies.</p>

are large, finely wainscoted and carved, particularly the
magnificent screen at the east end of the great hall, which is
adorned with two columns, their entablature and pediment; and on
acroters are placed the figure of Bacchus between several Fames,
with other embellishments; and they have a garden backwards
towards the Thames.</p>

<p>The public buildings in this ward are, Guildhall,
Mercers&rsquo; Chapel and Hall, Grocers&rsquo; Hall, the Poultry
Compter, the churches of St. Mildred, Poultry, and St. Lawrence
Jewry.</p>
<p>Guildhall, the town house of this great City, stands at the
north end of King Street, and is a large handsome structure,
built with stone, anno 1666, the old hall having been destroyed
by the Fire in 1666.&nbsp; By a large portico on the south side
we enter the principal room, properly called the hall, being 153
feet in length, 48 in breadth, and 55 in height.&nbsp; On the
right hand, at the upper end, is the ancient court of the
hustings; at the other end of the hall opposite to it are the
Sheriff&rsquo;s Courts.&nbsp; The roof of the inside is flat,
divided into panels; the walls on the north and south sides
adorned with four demy pillars of the Gothic order, painted
white, and veined with blue, the capitals gilt with gold, and the
arms finely depicted in their proper colour, viz., at the east
the arms of St. Edward the Confessor, and of the Kings of England
the shield and cross of St. George.&nbsp; At the west end the
arms of the Confessor, those of England and France quarterly, and
the arms of England.&nbsp; On the fourteen demy pillars (above
the capital) are the king&rsquo;s arms, the arms of London, and
the arms of the twelve companies.&nbsp; At the east end are the
King&rsquo;s arms carved between the portraits of the late Queen,
at the foot of an arabathram, under a rich canopy northward, and
those of King William and Queen Mary southward, painted at full
length.&nbsp; The inter-columns are painted in imitation of
porphyry, and embellished with the portraitures, painted in full
proportion, of eighteen judges, which were there put up by the
City, in gratitude for their signal service done in determining
differences between landlord and tenant (without the expense of
lawsuits) in rebuilding this City, pursuant to an Act of
Parliament, after the Fire, in 1666.</p>
<p>Those on the south side are, Sir Heneage Finch, Sir Orlando
Bridgeman, Sir Matthew Hale, Sir Richard Rainsford, Sir Edward
Turner, Sir Thomas Tyrrel, Sir John Archer, Sir William
Morton.</p>
<p>On the north side are, Sir Robert Atkins, Sir John Vaughan,
Sir Francis North, Sir Thomas Twisden, Sir Christopher Turner,
Sir William Wild, Sir Hugh Windham.</p>
<p>At the west end, Sir William Ellis, Sir Edward Thurland, Sir
Timothy Littleton.</p>
<p>And in the Lord Mayor&rsquo;s Court (which is adorned with
fleak stone and other painting and gilding, and also the figures
of the four cardinal virtues) are the portraits of Sir Samuel
Brown, Sir John Kelynge, Sir Edward Atkins, and Sir William
Windham, all (as those above) painted in full proportion in their
scarlet robes as judges.</p>
<p>The late Queen Anne, in December, 1706, gave the City 26
standards, and 63 colours, to be put up in this hall, that were
taken from the French and Bavarians at the battle of Ramillies
the preceding summer; but there was found room only for 46
colours, 19 standards, and the trophy of a kettle-drum of the
Elector of Bavaria&rsquo;s.&nbsp; The colours over the
Queen&rsquo;s picture are most esteemed, on account of their
being taken from the first battalion of French guards.</p>
<p>From the hall we ascend by nine stone steps to the
Mayor&rsquo;s Court, Council Chamber, and the rest of the
apartments of the house, which, notwithstanding it may not be
equal to the grandeur of the City, is very well adapted to the
ends it was designed for, namely, for holding the City courts,
for the election of sheriffs and other officers, and for the
entertainment of princes, ministers of State, and foreign
ambassadors, on their grand festivals.</p>
<p>17.&nbsp; Coleman Street Ward.&nbsp; The principal streets in
this ward are the Old Jewry, part of Lothbury, Coleman Street,
part of London Wall, and all the lower part of Moorfields without
the walls.</p>
<p>The public buildings are Bethlem or Bedlam Hospital,
Founders&rsquo; Hall, Armourers&rsquo; Hall, the churches of St.
Olave Jewry, St. Margaret, Lothbury, and St. Stephen, Coleman
Street.</p>
<p>New Bethlem, or Bedlam, is situated at the south end of
Moorfields, just without the wall, the ground being formerly part
of the town ditch, and granted by the City to the governors of
the hospital of Old Bethlem, which had been appropriated for the
reception of lunatics, but was found too strait to contain the
people brought thither, and the building in a decaying
condition.</p>
<p>The present edifice, called New Bedlam, was begun to be
erected anno 1675, and finished the following year.&nbsp; It is
built of brick and stone; the wings at each end, and the portico,
being each of them adorned with four pilasters, entablature and
circular pediment of the Corinthian order.&nbsp; Under the
pediment are the King&rsquo;s arms, enriched with festoons; and
between the portico and each of the said wings is a triangular
pediment, with the arms of the City; and on a pediment over the
gate the figures of two lunatics, exquisitely carved.&nbsp; The
front of this magnificent hospital is reported to represent the
<i>Escurial</i> in Spain, and in some respects exceeds every
palace in or about London, being 528 feet in length, and
regularly built.&nbsp; The inside, it is true, is not answerable
to the grand appearance it makes without, being but 30 feet
broad, and consisting chiefly of a long gallery in each of the
two storeys that runs from one end of the house to the other; on
the south side whereof are little cells, wherein the patients
have their lodgings, and on the north the windows that give light
to the galleries, which are divided in the middle by a handsome
iron gate, to keep the men and women asunder.</p>
<p>In order to procure a person to be admitted into the hospital,
a petition must be preferred to a committee of the governors, who
sit at Bedlam seven at a time weekly, which must be signed by the
churchwardens, or other reputable persons of the parish the
lunatic belongs to, and also recommended to the said committee by
one of the governors; and this being approved by the president
and governors, and entered in a book, upon a vacancy (in their
turn) an order is granted for their being received into the
house, where the said lunatic is accommodated with a room, proper
physic and diet, gratis.&nbsp; The diet is very good and
wholesome, being commonly boiled beef, mutton, or veal, and
broth, with bread, for dinners on Sundays, Tuesdays, and
Thursdays, the other days bread, cheese, and butter, or on
Saturdays pease-pottage, rice-milk, furmity, or other pottage,
and for supper they have usually broth or milk pottage, always
with bread.&nbsp; And there is farther care taken, that some of
the committee go on a Saturday weekly to the said hospital to see
the provisions weighed, and that the same be good and rightly
expended.</p>
<p>18.&nbsp; Basinghall, or Bassishaw Ward, consisteth only of
Basinghall Street, and a small part of the street along London
Wall.</p>
<p>The public buildings of this ward are Blackwell Hall,
Masons&rsquo; Hall, Weavers&rsquo; Hall, Coopers&rsquo; Hall,
Girdlers&rsquo; Hall, and St. Michael Bassishaw Church.</p>
<p>Blackwell Hall is situated between Basinghall Street on the
east, and Guildhall Yard on the west, being formerly called
Bakewell Hall, from the family of the Bakewells, whose
mansion-house stood here anno 1315, which falling to the Crown,
was purchased by the City of King Richard II., and converted into
a warehouse and market for woollen manufactures; and by an act of
common council anno 1516, it was appointed to be the only market
for woollen manufactures sold in the City, except baize, the
profits being settled on Christ&rsquo;s Hospital, which arise
from the lodging and pitching of the cloth in the respective
warehouses, there being one assigned for the Devonshire cloths,
and others for the Gloucester, Worcester, Kentish, Medley,
Spanish cloths, and blankets.&nbsp; The profits also of the baize
brought to Leadenhall are settled on the same hospital.&nbsp;
These cloths pay a penny a week each for pitching, and a
halfpenny a week resting; stockings and blankets pay by the pack,
all which bring in a considerable revenue, being under the
direction of the governors of Christ&rsquo;s Hospital.&nbsp; This
hall was destroyed by the Fire, and rebuilt by Christ&rsquo;s
Hospital, anno 1672.&nbsp; The doorcase on the front towards
Guildhall is of stone, adorned with two columns, entablature, and
pediment of the Doric order.&nbsp; In the pediment are the
King&rsquo;s arms, and the arms of London under them, enriched
with Cupids, &amp;c.</p>
<p>19.&nbsp; Cripplegate Ward is usually divided into two parts,

<p>Sion College is situated against London Wall, a little to the
eastward of Cripplegate, where anciently stood a nunnery, and
afterwards a hospital founded for a hundred blind men,
<i>anno</i> 1320, by W. Elsing, mercer, and called Elsing&rsquo;s
Spittal: he afterwards founded here a priory for canons regular,
which being surrendered to King Henry VIII. <i>anno</i> 1530, it
was purchased by Dr. Thomas White, residentiary of St.
Paul&rsquo;s, and vicar of St. Dunstan&rsquo;s in the West, for
the use of the London clergy, who were incorporated by King
Charles I., <i>anno</i> 1631, by the name of the president and
fellows of Sion College, for the glory of God, the good of His
Church, redress of inconveniences, and maintaining of truth in
doctrine, and love in conversation with one another, pursuant to
the donor&rsquo;s will; which college is governed by the
president, two deans and four assistants, who are yearly elected
out of the London clergy, on the third Tuesday after Easter; but
none of them reside there, the whole being left to the care of
the librarian.&nbsp; The great gate against London Wall is
adorned with two columns, their entablature and pitched pediment
of the Tuscan order, whereon is this inscription in gold
letters:&mdash;</p>
<p><i>Collegium Sionis a Thoma White</i>, <i>S. T. P. Fundatum
Anno Christi</i> 1631, <i>in Usum Clerici Lond</i>.&nbsp;
<i>Bibliotheca a Johanne Simpson</i>, <i>S. T. B. Extracta</i>,
<i>a diversis Benefactor</i>, <i>Libris locupletata</i>, <i>&amp;
in posterum locupletanda</i>.&nbsp; <i>Vade &amp; fac
similiter</i>.</p>
<p>The college consists of a handsome hall, the president&rsquo;s
lodgings, chambers for students, and a well-disposed library, one
hundred and twenty feet in length, and thirty in breadth, which
is at this day very well replenished with books, notwithstanding
both library and college were burnt down <i>anno</i> 1666.&nbsp;
It was rebuilt and furnished by contributions from the London
clergy and their friends.&nbsp; The library is kept in exact
order, and there are all imaginable conveniences for those who
desire to consult their books.</p>

<p>St. Martin&rsquo;s-le-Grand was anciently a magnificent
college, founded by Jugelricus and Edwardus his brother,
<i>anno</i> 1056, and confirmed by William the Conqueror, by his
charter, dated <i>anno</i> 1068, in the second year of his reign,
who also gave all the moorlands without Cripplegate to this
college, exempting the dean and canons from the jurisdiction of
the bishop, and from all legal services, granting them soc and
sac, toll and theam, with all liberties and franchises that any
church in the kingdom enjoyed.</p>
<p>This college was surrendered to King Edward VI. in the second
year of his reign, anno 1548, and the same year the church pulled
down, and the ground leased out to persons to build upon, being
highly valued on account of the privileges annexed to it, for it
still remains a separate jurisdiction.&nbsp; The sheriffs and
magistrates of London have no authority in this liberty, but it
is esteemed part of Westminster, and subject only to the dean and
chapter of that abbey.</p>
<p>The public buildings in this ward are, Goldsmiths&rsquo; Hall,
Coachmakers&rsquo; Hall, London House, Thanet House, Cooks&rsquo;
Hall, the church of St. Anne within Aldersgate, St. Leonard,
Foster Lane, and St. Botolph, Aldersgate.</p>
<p>21.&nbsp; Farringdon Ward within the walls, so called to
distinguish it from Farringdon Ward without, was anciently but
one ward, and governed by one alderman, receiving its name of
William Farendon, goldsmith, alderman thereof, and one of the
sheriffs of London who purchased the aldermanry of John le Feure,
7 Edward I., <i>anno</i> 1279.&nbsp; It afterwards descended to
Nicholas Farendon, son of the said William, who was four times
mayor (and his heirs), from whence some infer that the
aldermanries of London were formerly hereditary.</p>
<p>Farringdon Ward Within contains St. Paul&rsquo;s Churchyard,
Ludgate Street, Blackfriars, the east side of Fleet Ditch, from
Ludgate Street to the Thames, Creed Lane, Ave Mary Lane, Amen
Corner, Paternoster Row, Newgate Street and Market, Greyfriars,
part of Warwick Lane, Ivy Lane, part of Cheapside, part of Foster
Lane, part of Wood Street, part of Friday Street, and part of the
Old Change, with several courts and alleys falling into them.</p>
<p>The public buildings in this ward are, the Cathedral of St.
Paul, St. Paul&rsquo;s School, the King&rsquo;s Printing House,
the Scotch Hall, Apothecaries&rsquo; Hall, Stationers&rsquo;
Hall, the College of Physicians, Butchers&rsquo; Hall,
Saddlers&rsquo; Hall, Embroiderers&rsquo; Hall, the church of St.
Martin Ludgate, Christ&rsquo;s Church and Hospital, the church of
St. Matthew, Friday Street, St. Austin&rsquo;s Church, the church
of St Vedast, and the Chapter House.</p>
<p>Austin the monk was sent to England by Pope Gregory the Great,
to endeavour the conversion of the Saxons, about the year 596,
and being favourably received by Ethelbert, then King of Kent,
who soon after became his proselyte, was by the authority of the
Roman see constituted Archbishop of Canterbury, the capital of
King Ethelbert&rsquo;s dominions.&nbsp; The archbishop being thus
established in Kent, sent his missionaries into other parts of
England, making Melitus, one of his assistants, Bishop of London;
and King Ethelbert, to encourage that city to embrace
Christianity, it is said, founded the Cathedral of St. Paul about
the year 604.</p>
<p>This Cathedral stands upon an eminence in the middle of the
town, disengaged from all other buildings, so that its beauties
may be viewed on every side; whereas we see only one front of St.
Peter&rsquo;s at Rome, the palace of the Vatican, and other
buildings contiguous to it, rendering the rest invisible; and
though the riches and furniture of the several chapels in St.
Peter&rsquo;s are the admiration of all that view them, yet they
spoil the prospect of the fabric.&nbsp; If we regard only the
building, divested of the rich materials and furniture which hide
the beauties of the structure, St. Paul&rsquo;s, in the opinion
of many travellers, makes a better appearance than St.
Peter&rsquo;s: nor does the white Portland stone, of which St.
Paul&rsquo;s is built, at all give place to the marble St.
Peter&rsquo;s is lined or incrusted with; for the numerous lamps
and candles that are burnt before the altars at St. Peter&rsquo;s
so blacken and tarnish the marble, that it is not easy to
distinguish it from common stone.</p>
<p>As to the outside of St. Paul&rsquo;s, it is adorned by two
ranges of pilasters, one above the other; the lower consist of
120 pilasters at least, with their entablature of the Corinthian
order, and the upper of as many with entablament of the Composite
order, besides twenty columns at the west and four at the east
end, and those of the porticoes and spaces between the arches of
the windows; and the architrave of the lower order, &amp;c., are
filled with great variety of curious enrichments, consisting of
cherubims, festoons, volutas, fruit, leaves, car-touches, ensigns
of fame, as swords and trumpets in saltier crosses, with chaplets
of laurel, also books displayed, bishops&rsquo; caps, the
dean&rsquo;s arms, and, at the east end, the cypher of W.R.
within a garter, on which are the words <i>Honi soit qui mal y
pense</i>, and this within a fine compartment of palm-branches,
and placed under an imperial crown, &amp;c., all finely carved in
stone.</p>
<p>The intercolumns of the lower range of pilasters are
thirty-three ornamental windows and six niches, and of the upper
range thirty-seven windows and about thirty niches, many whereof
are adorned with columns, entablature, and pediments; and at the
east end is a sweep, or circular space, adorned with columns and
pilasters, and enriched with festoons, fruit, incense-pots,
&amp;c., and at the upper part is a window between four
pieddroits and a single cornice, and those between two large
cartouches.</p>
<p>The ascent to the north portico is by twelve steps of black
marble; the dome of the portico is supported and adorned with six
very spacious columns (forty-eight inches diameter) of the
Corinthian order.&nbsp; Above the doorcase is a large urn, with
festoons, &amp;c.&nbsp; Over this (belonging to the upper range
of pilasters) is a spacious pediment, where are the king&rsquo;s
arms with the regalia, supported by two angels, with each a
palm-branch in their hands, under whose feet appear the figures
of the lion and unicorn.</p>
<p>You ascend to the fourth portico (the ground here being low)
by twenty-five steps.&nbsp; It is in all other respects like the
north, and above this a pediment, as the other, belonging to the
upper order, where is a proper emblem of this incomparable
structure, raised, as it were, out of the ruins of the old
church, viz., a phoenix, with her wings expanded, in flames,
under which is the word RESURGAM insculped in capital
characters.</p>
<p>The west portico is adorned and supported with twelve columns
below and eight above, fluted, of the respective orders as the
two ranges, the twelve lower adorned with architrave, marble
frieze, and a cornice, and the eight upper with an entablature
and a spacious triangular pediment, where the history of St.
Paul&rsquo;s conversion is represented, with the rays of a glory
and the figures of several men and horses boldly carved in
relievo by Mr. Bird.&nbsp; The doorcase is white marble, and over
the entrance is cut in relieve the history of St. Paul&rsquo;s
preaching to the Bereans (as in Acts xvii. 2).&nbsp; It consists
of a group of nine figures, besides that of St. Paul, with books,
&amp;c., lively represented by the same hand as &ldquo;The
Conversion.&rdquo;</p>
<p>On the south side of the church, near the west end, is a forum
or portal, the doorcase being enriched with cartouches, volutas,
and fruit, very excellently carved under a pediment, and opposite
to this on the north side is the like doorcase.&nbsp; And, in
brief, all the apertures are not only judiciously disposed for
commodiousness, illumination of the fabric, &amp;c., but are very
ornamental.</p>
<p>At the west end is an acroteria of the figures of the twelve
apostles, each about eleven feet high, with that of St. Paul on
the angle of the pediment, and those of the four evangelists, two
of each cumbent between as many angles on a circular
pediment.&nbsp; Over the dials of the clock on the fronts of the
two towers, also an entablature and circles of enrichment, where
twelve stones compose the aperture, answering to the twelve
hours.</p>
<p>The said towers are adorned with circular ranges of columns of
the Corinthian order, with domes upon the upper part, and at the
vertex of each a curious pineapple.</p>
<p>The choir has its roof supported with six spacious pillars,
and the church with six more, besides which there are eight that
support the cupola and two very spacious ones at the west
end.&nbsp; All which pillars are adorned with pilasters of the
Corinthian and Composite orders, and also with columns fronting
the cross-aisle, or ambulatory, between the consistory and
morning prayer chapel, which have each a very beautiful screen of
curious wainscot, and adorned each with twelve columns, their
entablatures arched pediments, and the king&rsquo;s arms,
enriched with cherubims, and each pediment between four vases,
all curiously carved.&nbsp; These screens are fenced with
ironwork, as is also the cornice at the west end of the church,
and so eastward beyond the first arch.</p>
<p>The pillars of the church that support the roof are two
ranges, with their entablature and beautiful arches, whereby the
body of the church and choir are divided into three parts or
aisles.&nbsp; The roof of each is adorned with arches and
spacious peripheries of enrichments, as shields, leaves,
chaplets, &amp;c. (the spaces included being somewhat concave),
admirably carved in stone; and there is a large cross aisle
between the north and south porticoes, and two ambulatories, the
one a little eastward, the other westward from the said
cross-aisle, and running parallel therewith.&nbsp; The floor of
the whole is paved with marble, but under the cupola and within
the rail of the altar with fine porphyry, polished and laid in
several geometrical figures.</p>
<p>The altar-piece is adorned with four noble fluted pilasters,
finely painted and veined with gold, in imitation of <i>lapis
lazuli</i>, with their entablature, where the enrichments, and
also the capitals of the pilasters, are double gilt with
gold.&nbsp; These intercolumns are twenty-one panels of figured
crimson velvet, and above them six windows, viz., in each
intercolumniation seven panels and two windows, one above the
other; at the greatest altitude above all which is a glory finely
done.&nbsp; The aperture north and south into the choir are
(ascending up three steps of black marble) by two iron
folding-doors, being, as that under the organ-gallery, &amp;c.,
exquisitely wrought into divers figures, spiral branches, and
other flourishes.&nbsp; There are two others at the west end of
the choir, the one opening into the south aisle, the other in the
north, done by the celebrated artist in this way, M. Tijan.</p>
<p>And what contributes to the beauty of this choir are the
galleries, the bishop&rsquo;s throne, Lord Mayor&rsquo;s seat,
with the stalls, all which being contiguous, compose one vast
body of carved work of the finest wainscot, constituting three
sides of a quadrangle.</p>
<p>The cupola (within the church) appears erected and elevated on
eight pillars of a large magnitude, adorned with pilasters,
entablature, circular pediments, and arches of the Corinthian
order, and each pillar enriched with a spacious festoon.&nbsp;
Here are also as many alcoves fronted with curious ironwork, and
over the arches, at a great height from the ground, is an
entablature, and on the cornice an ambulatory, fronted or fenced
in with handsome ironwork, extending round the inside of the
cupola, above which is a range of thirty-two pilasters of the
Corinthian order, where every fourth intercolumn is adorned with
a niche and some enrichments; and it said that in every foot of
altitude the diameter of this decreaseth one inch.</p>
<p>On the outside of the dome, about twenty feet above the outer
roof of the church, is a range of thirty-two columns, with niches
of the same altitude, and directly counter to those aforesaid
within the cupola.&nbsp; To these columns there is entablament,
and above that a gallery with acroteria, where are placed very
spacious and ornamental vases all round the cupola.&nbsp; At
twelve feet above the tops of these vases (which space is adorned
with pilasters and entablament, and the intercolumns are windows)
the diameter is taken in (as appears outwardly) five feet, and
two feet higher it decreases five feet, and a foot above that it
is still five feet less, where the dome outwardly begins to arch,
which arches meet about fifty-two feet higher in perpendicular
altitude, on the vertex of which dome is a neat balcony, and
above this a large and beautiful lantern, adorned with columns of
the Corinthian order, with a ball and cross at the top.</p>
<p>Christ&rsquo;s Hospital is situated between Newgate Street and
St. Bartholomew&rsquo;s Hospital in Smithfield.&nbsp; Here, as
has been observed already, was anciently a monastery of grey
friars, founded about the year 1325, which, upon the dissolution
of monasteries, was surrendered to King Henry VIII., anno 1538,
who, in the last year of his reign, transferred it to the City of
London for the use of the poor.&nbsp; King Edward VI. endowed
this hospital&mdash;together with those of Bridewell and St.
Thomas&rsquo;s Hospital in Southwark&mdash;with large revenues,
of which the City were made trustees, and incorporated by the
name of the mayor, commonalty, and citizens of the City of
London, governors of the possessions, revenues, and goods of the
hospitals of Christ, Bridewell, and St. Thomas the Apostle, to
whom the king granted &pound;3,266 13s. 4d. per annum.</p>
<p>It was opened in the year 1552, in the month of November, and
a good writing-school was added to this foundation in the year
1694 by Sir John More, Kt., and alderman.</p>
<p>The children admitted into this hospital are presented every
year by the Lord Mayor and aldermen and the other governors in
their turns, a list of whom is printed yearly and set up at the
counting-house, and a letter is sent to each of the said
governors, some days before the admission, reminding him of the
day of choosing, and how those he presents should be qualified,
wherein is enclosed a blank certificate from the minister and
churchwardens, a blank petition to the president and governors,
and a paper of the rules and qualifications of the child to be
presented.&nbsp; Upon this the governor, having made choice of a
child to present, the friends of the said child come to the
counting-house on the admission-day, bringing the said petition
and certificates, rules, and letter along with him, and on the
back side of the said petition the governor who presents
endorseth words to this effect.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I present the child mentioned in the certificate on the
other side, and believe the same to be a true certificate.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Witness my hand . . . the day . . . of 17.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Which the said governor signeth, and the child is admitted.</p>
<p>The said rules and qualifications are as follows:</p>
<p>1.&nbsp; That no child be taken in but such as are the
children of freemen of London.</p>
<p>2.&nbsp; That none be taken in under seven years old.</p>
<p>3.&nbsp; That none be taken in but orphans, wanting either
father or mother, or both.</p>
<p>4.&nbsp; That no foundlings, or that are maintained at the
parish charge, be taken in.</p>
<p>5.&nbsp; That none who are lame, crooked, or deformed, or that
have the evil, rupture, or any infectious disease, be taken
in.</p>
<p>6.&nbsp; That none be admitted but such as are without any
probable means of being provided for otherways; nor without a due
certificate from the minister, churchwardens, and three or four
of the principal inhabitants of the parish whence any children
come, certifying the poverty and inability of the parent to
maintain such children, and the true age of the said child, and
engaging to discharge the hospital of them before or after the
age of fifteen years if a boy, or fourteen years if a girl, which
shall be left to the governor&rsquo;s pleasure to do; so that it
shall be wholly in the power of the hospital to dispose of such
child, or return them to the parent or parish, as to the hospital
shall seem good.</p>
<p>7.&nbsp; That no child be admitted that hath a brother or
sister in the hospital already.</p>
<p>8.&nbsp; To the end that no children be admitted contrary to
the rules abovesaid, when the general court shall direct the
taking in of any children, they shall (before taken in) be
presented to a committee, consisting of the president, treasurer,
or the almoners, renters, scrutineers, and auditors, and all
other governors to be summoned at the first time, and so to
adjourn from time to time: and that they, or any thirteen or more
of them, whereof the president or treasurer for the time being to
be one, shall strictly examine touching the age, birth, and
quality of such children, and of the truth of the said
certificates; and when such committee shall find cause, they
shall forbid or suspend the taking in of any child, until they
receive full satisfaction that such child or children are duly
qualified according to the rules abovesaid.</p>
<p>And that such children as may be presented to be admitted in
pursuance of the will of any benefactor, shall be examined by the
said committee, who are to take care that such children be
qualified according to the wills of the donors or benefactors (as
near as may consist with such wills) agreeing to the
qualifications above.</p>
<p>The Lord Mayor and Court of Aldermen present each their child
yearly, but the rest of the governors only in their turns, which
may happen once in three or four years.</p>
<p>No child is continued in after fifteen years of age, except
the mathematical scholars, who are sometimes in till they are
eighteen, and who, at the beginning of the seventh year of their
service as mariners are at His Majesty&rsquo;s disposal; and of
these children there is an account printed yearly, and presented
to the king the 1st of January, setting forth, (1) each
boy&rsquo;s name; (2) the month and year when they were bound
out; (3) their age; (4) the names of their masters; (5) the names
of the ships whereof they are commanders; (6) what country trade
they are in; (7) the month and year when they will be at His
Majesty&rsquo;s disposal.&nbsp; Also an account of the forty
children annually enjoying the benefit of this mathematical
foundation, &amp;c., setting forth their names and age.</p>
<p>The governors, besides the Lord Mayor and aldermen, are many,
and commonly persons that have been masters or wardens of their
companies, or men of estates, from whom there is some expectation
of additional charities.&nbsp; Out of these one is made
president, who is usually some ancient alderman that hath passed
the chair; another is appointed treasurer, to whom the care of
the house and of the revenues are committed, who is therefore
usually resident, and has a good house within the limits of the
hospital.&nbsp; There are two governors also, who are called
<i>almoners</i>, whose business it is to buy provisions for the
house and send them in, who are attended by the steward.</p>
<p>The children are dieted in the following manner: They have
every morning for their breakfast bread and beer, at half an hour
past six in the morning in the summer time, and at half an hour
past seven in the winter.&nbsp; On Sundays they have boiled beef
and broth for their dinners, and for their suppers legs and
shoulders of mutton.&nbsp; On Tuesdays and Thursdays they have
the same dinners as on Sundays, that is, boiled beef and broth;
on the other days no flesh meat, but on Mondays milk-porridge, on
Wednesdays furmity, on Fridays old pease and pottage, on
Saturdays water-gruel.&nbsp; They have roast beef about twelve
days in the year by the kindness of several benefactors, who have
left, some &pound;3, some 50s. per annum, for that end.&nbsp;
Their supper is bread and cheese, or butter for those who cannot
eat cheese; only Wednesdays and Fridays they heave pudding-pies
for supper.</p>
<p>The diet of these children seems to be exceeding mean and
sparing; and I have heard some of their friends say that it would
not be easy for them to subsist upon it without their
assistance.&nbsp; However, it is observed they are very
healthful; that out of eleven or twelve hundred there are scarce
ever found twelve in the sick ward; and that in one year, when
there were upwards of eleven hundred in this hospital, there were
not more than fifteen of them died.&nbsp; Besides, their living
in this thrifty parsimonious manner, makes them better capable of
shifting for themselves when they come out into the world.</p>
<p>As to the education of these orphans, here is a
grammar-school, a writing-school, a mathematical-school, and a
drawing-school.</p>
<p>As to grammar and writing, they have all of them the benefit
of these schools without distinction; but the others are for such
lads as are intended for the sea-service.</p>
<p>The first mathematical school was founded by King Charles II.,
anno domini 1673.&nbsp; His Majesty gave &pound;7,000 towards
building and furnishing this school, and settled a revenue of
&pound;370 per annum upon it for ever; and there has been since
another mathematical school erected here, which is maintained out
of the revenues of the hospital, as is likewise the
drawing-school.</p>
<p>This hospital is built about a large quadrangle, with a
cloister or piazza on the inside of it, which is said to be part
of the monastery of the Grey Friars; but most part of the house
has been rebuilt since the Fire, and consists of a large hall,
and the several schools and dormitories for the children; besides
which there is a fine house at Hertford, and another at Ware,
twenty miles from London, whither the youngest orphans are
usually sent, and taught to read, before they are fixed at
London.</p>
<p>The College of Physicians is situated on the west side of
Warwick Lane.&nbsp; It is a beautiful and magnificent edifice,
built by the society anno 1682, their former college in Amen
Corner having been destroyed by the Fire.&nbsp; It is built of
brick and stone, having a fine frontispiece, with a handsome
doorcase, within which is a lofty cupola erected on strong
pillars, on the top whereof is a large pyramid, and on its vertex
a crown and gilded ball.&nbsp; Passing under the cupola we come
into a quadrangular court, the opposite side whereof is adorned
with eight pilasters below and eight above, with their
entablature and a triangular pediment; over the doorcase is the
figure of King Charles II. placed in a niche and between the door
and the lower architrave the following inscription,
viz.:&mdash;</p>
<p>VTRIVSQVE FORTVN&AElig; EXEMPLAR INGENS ADVERSIS REBVS DEVM
PROBAVIT PROSPERIS SEIPSVM COLLEGIJ HVJUSCE, 1682.</p>
<p>The apartments within consist of a hall, where advice is given
to the poor gratis; a committee-room, a library, another great
hall, where the doctors meet once a quarter, which is beautifully
wainscoted, carved, and adorned with fretwork.&nbsp; Here are the
pictures of Dr. Harvey, who first discovered the circulation of
the blood, and other benefactors, and northward from this, over
the library, is the censor&rsquo;s room.</p>
<p>The theatre under the cupola at the entrance is furnished with
six degrees of circular wainscot seats, one above the other, and
in the pit is a table and three seats, one for the president, a
second for the operator, and a third for the lecturer; and here
the anatomy lectures are performed.&nbsp; In the preparing room
are thirteen tables of the muscles in a human body, each muscle
in its proper position.</p>
<p>This society is a body-corporate for the practice of physic
within London, and several miles about it.&nbsp; The president
and censors are chosen annually at Michaelmas.&nbsp; None can
practise physic, though they have taken their degrees, without
their license, within the limits aforesaid; and they have a power
to search all apothecaries&rsquo; shops, and to destroy
unwholesome medicines.</p>
<p>By the charter of King Charles II. this college was to consist
of a president, four censors, ten elects, and twenty-six fellows;
the censors to be chosen out of the fellows, and the president
out of the elects.</p>
<p>By the charter granted by King James II., the number of
fellows was enlarged, but not to exceed eighty, and none but
those who had taken the degree of doctors in the British or
foreign universities were qualified to be admitted members of
this college.</p>
<p>The fellows meet four times every year, viz., on the Monday
after every quarter-day, and two of them meet twice a week, to
give advice to the poor gratis.&nbsp; Here are also prepared
medicines for the poor at moderate rates.</p>
<p>The president and four censors meet the first Friday in every
month.&nbsp; The Lord Chancellor, chief justices, and chief
baron, are constituted visitors of this corporation, whose
privileges are established by several Acts of Parliament.</p>
<p>22.&nbsp; Bread Street Ward contains Bread Street, Friday
Street, Distaff Lane, Basing Lane, part of the Old Change, part
of Watling Street, part of Old Fish Street, and Trinity Lane, and
part of Cheapside.</p>
<p>The only public buildings in this ward are the churches of
Allhallows, Bread Street, and St. Mildred, Bread Street.</p>

Queenhithe, with the several lanes running southward to the
Thames, Lambeth Hill, Fish Street Hill, Five Foot Lane, Little
Trinity Lane, Bread Street Hill, Huggin Lane, with the south side
of Great Trinity Lane, and part of Old Fish Streets.</p>
<p>Queenhithe lies to the westward of the Three Cranes, and is a
harbour for barges, lighters, and other vessels, that bring meal,
malt, and other provisions down the Thames; being a square inlet,
with wharves on three sides of it, where the greatest market in
England for meal, malt, &amp;c., is held every day in the week,
but chiefly on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays.&nbsp; It
received the name of Queenhithe, or harbour, from the duties
anciently paid here to the Queens of England.</p>
<p>24.&nbsp; Baynard&rsquo;s Castle Ward contains Peter&rsquo;s
Hill, Bennet&rsquo;s Hill, part of Thames Street, Paul&rsquo;s
Wharf, Puddle Dock, Addle Hill, Knightrider Street, Carter Lane,
Wardrobe Court, Paul&rsquo;s Chain, part of St. Paul&rsquo;s
Churchyard, Dean&rsquo;s Court, part of Creed Lane, and part of

<p>The public buildings in this ward are Doctors&rsquo; Commons,
the Heralds&rsquo; Office, the churches of St. Bennet,
Paul&rsquo;s Wharf, St. Andrew, Wardrobe, and St. Mary Magdalen,
Old Fish Street.</p>
<p>Doctors&rsquo; Commons, so called from the doctors of the
civil law commoning together here as in a college, is situated on
the west side of Bennet&rsquo;s Hill, and consists chiefly of one
handsome square court.&nbsp; And here are held the Court of
Admiralty, Court of Arches, and the Prerogative Court of the
Archbishop of Canterbury.&nbsp; Near the Commons are the
Prerogative Office and Faculty Office.</p>
<p>The Heralds&rsquo; College or office is situated on the east
side of Bennet&rsquo;s Hill, almost against Doctors&rsquo;
Commons.&nbsp; It is a spacious building, with a square court in
the middle of it, on the north side whereof is the Court-room,
where the Earl Marshal sits to hear causes lying in the court of
honour concerning arms, achievements, titles of honour,
&amp;c.</p>

<p>West Smithfield&mdash;or, rather, Smoothfield, according to
Stow&mdash;is an open place, containing little more than three
acres of ground at present, of an irregular figure, surrounded
with buildings of various kinds.&nbsp; Here is held one of the
greatest markets of oxen and sheep in Europe, as may easily be
imagined when it appears to be the only market for live cattle in
this great city, which is held on Mondays and Fridays.&nbsp;
There is also a market for horses on Fridays; nor is there
anywhere better riding-horses to be purchased, if the buyer has
skill, though it must be confessed there is a great deal of
jockeying and sharping used by the dealers in horseflesh.&nbsp;
As for coach-horses, and those fit for troopers, they are usually
purchased in the counties to the northward of the town.&nbsp; The
famous fair on the feast of St. Bartholomew also is held in this
place, which lasts three days, and, by the indulgence of the City
magistrates, sometimes a fortnight.&nbsp; The first three days
were heretofore assigned for business, as the sale of cattle,
leather, &amp;c., but now only for diversion, the players filling
the area of the field with their booths, whither the young
citizens resort in crowds.</p>
<p>The public buildings in this ward are Bridewell,
Serjeants&rsquo; Inn in Fleet Street, the Temple, the Six
Clerks&rsquo; Office, the Rolls, Serjeants&rsquo; Inn in Chancery
Lane, Clifford&rsquo;s Inn, the House of the Royal Society,

Bride&rsquo;s, and St. Dunstan&rsquo;s-in-the-West.</p>
<p>Bridewell is situated on the west side of Fleet Ditch, a
little to the southward of Fleet Street, having two fronts, one
to the east, and the other to the north, with a handsome great
gate in each of them.&nbsp; It consists chiefly of two courts,
the innermost being the largest and best built, four or five
storeys high, on the south side whereof is a noble hall, adorned
with the pictures of King Edward VI. and his Privy Council, King
Charles, and King James II., Sir William Turner, Sir William
Jeffreys, and other benefactors.</p>
<p>It was one of the palaces of the Kings of England till the
reign of King Edward VI., who gave it to the City of London for
the use of their poor, with lands of the value of 700 marks per
annum, and bedding and furniture out of the Hospital of the
Savoy, then suppressed.</p>
<p>Here are lodgings and several privileges for certain
tradesmen, such as flax-dressers, tailors, shoemakers, &amp;c.,
called art masters, who are allowed to take servants and
apprentices to the number of about 140, who are clothed in blue
vests at the charge of the house, their masters having the profit
of their labour.&nbsp; These boys having served their times, have
their freedom, and ten pound each given them towards carrying on
their trades; and some of them have arrived to the honour of
being governors of the house where they served.</p>
<p>This Hospital is at present under the direction of a
president, and some hundreds of the most eminent and substantial
citizens, with their inferior officers; and a court is held every
Friday, where such vagrants and lewd people are ordered to
receive correction in the sight of the Court, as are adjudged to
deserve it.</p>
<p>Among the public buildings of this ward, that belonging to the
Royal Society, situate at the north end of Two Crane Court, in
Fleet Street, must not be omitted, though it be much more
considerable on account of the learned members who assemble
there, and the great advances that have been made by them of late
years in natural philosophy, &amp;c., than for the elegancy of
the building.</p>
<p>During the grand rebellion, when the estates of the prime
nobility and gentry were sequestered, and there was no court for
them to resort to, the then powers encouraging only the maddest
enthusiast, or the basest of the people, whom they looked upon as
the fittest instruments to support their tyranny; some ingenious
gentlemen, who had applied themselves chiefly to their studies,
and abhorred the usurpation, proposed the erecting a society for
the improvement of natural knowledge, which might be an innocent
and inoffensive exercise to themselves in those troublesome
times, and of lasting benefit to the nation.&nbsp; Their first
meeting, it is said, were at the chambers of Mr. Wilkins
(afterwards Bishop of Chester) in Wadham College, in Oxford,
about the year 1650, and the members consisted of the Honourable
Robert Boyle, Esq., Dr. Ward (afterwards Bishop of Salisbury),
Sir Christopher Wren, Sir William Petty, Dr. Wallis, Dr. Goddard,
and Dr. Hook (late Professor of Geometry), the above-named Bishop
Wilkins, and others.&nbsp; In the year 1658 we find them
assembling in Gresham College, in London, when were added to
their number the Lord Brounker (their first president), Sir
Robert Murray, John Evelyng, Esq., Sir George Ent, Dr. Croon,
Henry Shingsby, Esq., and many others.&nbsp; And after the
Restoration, his Majesty King Charles II. appeared so well
pleased with the design, that he granted them a charter of
incorporation, bearing date the 22nd of April, 15 Charles II.,
anno 1663, wherein he styled himself their founder, patron, and
companion; and the society was from thenceforward to consist of a
president, a council of twenty, and as many fellows as should be
thought worthy of admission, with a treasurer, secretary,
curators, and other officers.</p>
<p>When a gentleman desires to be admitted to the society, he
procures one of the Corporation to recommend him as a person duly
qualified, whereupon his name is entered in a book, and proper
inquiries made concerning his merit and abilities; and if the
gentleman is approved of, he appears in some following assembly,
and subscribes a paper, wherein he promises that he will
endeavour to promote the welfare of the society: and the
president formally admits him by saying, &ldquo;I do, by the
authority and in the name of the Royal Society of London for
improving of natural knowledge, admit you a member
thereof.&rdquo;&nbsp; Whereupon the new fellow pays forty
shillings to the treasurer, and two-and-fifty shillings per annum
afterwards by quarterly payments, towards the charges of the
experiments, the salaries of the officers of the house,
&amp;c.</p>
<p>Behind the house they have a repository, containing a
collection of the productions of nature and art.&nbsp; They have
also a well-chosen library, consisting of many thousand volumes,
most of them relating to natural philosophy; and they publish
from time to time the experiments made by them, of which there
are a great number of volumes, called &ldquo;Philosophical
Transactions.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Hospital of St. Bartholomew, on the south side of
Smithfield, is contiguous to the church of Little St.
Bartholomew.&nbsp; It was at first governed by a master, eight
brethren, and four sisters, who had the care of the sick and
infirm that were brought thither.&nbsp; King Henry VIII. endowed
it with a yearly revenue of five hundred more yearly for the
relief of one hundred infirm people.&nbsp; And since that time
the hospital is so increased and enlarged, by the benefactions
given to it, that it receives infirm people at present from all
parts of England.&nbsp; In the year 1702 a beautiful frontispiece
was erected towards Smithfield, adorned with pilasters,
entablature, and pediment of the Ionic order, with the figure of
the founder, King Henry VIII., in a niche, standing in full
proportion; and the figures of two cripples on the pediment: but
the most considerable improvements to the building were made in
the year 1731, of the old buildings being pulled down, and a
magnificent pile erected in the room of them about 150 feet in
length, faced with a pure white stone, besides other additions
now building.</p>
<p>There are two houses belonging to this hospital, the one in
Kent Street, called the Lock, and the other at Kingsland, whither
such unfortunate people as are afflicted with the French disease
are sent and taken care of, that they may not prove offensive to
the rest; for surely more miserable objects never were beheld,
many of them having their noses and great part of their faces
eaten off, and become so noisome frequently, that their stench
cannot be borne, their very bones rotting while they remain
alive.</p>
<p>This hospital is governed by the Lord Mayor and Aldermen, with
about three hundred other substantial citizens and gentlemen of
quality, who generally become benefactors; and from these and
their friends the hospital has been able to subsist such numbers
of infirm people, and to perform the surprising cures they have
done; for the patients are duly attended by the best physicians
and surgeons in London, and so well supplied with lodging and
diet proper to their respective cases, that much fewer miscarry
here, in proportion, than in the great hospital of invalids, and
others the French so much boast of in Paris.</p>
<p>Those that have the immediate care of the hospital are, the
president, the treasurer, the auditors of accounts, viewers of
their revenues, overseers of the goods and utensils of the
hospital, and the almoners, who buy in provisions and necessaries
for the patients.</p>
<p>A committee, consisting of the treasurer, almoners, and some
other of the governors, meet twice a week to inspect the
government of the house, to discharge such persons as are cured,
and to admit others.</p>
<p>26.&nbsp; Bridge Ward Without contains in chief the Borough,
or Long Southwark, St. Margaret&rsquo;s Hill, Blackman Street,
Stony Street, St. Thomas&rsquo;s Street, Counter Street, the Mint
Street, Maiden Lane, the Bankside, Bandy-leg Walk, Bennet&rsquo;s
Rents, George Street, Suffolk Street, Redcross Street, Whitecross
Street, Worcester Street, Castle Street, Clink Street,
Deadman&rsquo;s Place, New Rents, Gravel Lane, Dirty Lane, St.
Olave&rsquo;s Street, Horselydown, Crucifix Lane, Five-foot Lane,
Barnaby Street, Long Lane and Street.</p>
<p>The Bankside consists of certain houses so called from their
lying on the south bank of the Thames to the westward of the
bridge.</p>
<p>The public buildings in this ward are, St. Thomas&rsquo;s
Church and Hospital, Guy&rsquo;s Hospital for Incurables, the
church of St. Saviour, the church of St. Olave, and that of St.
George, the Bridge House, the King&rsquo;s Bench Prison, the
Marshalsea, and the Clink Prison, the Sessions House, Compter,
and New Prison.</p>
<p>The Hospital of St. Thomas consists of four spacious courts,
in the first of which are six wards for women.&nbsp; In the
second stands the church, and another chapel, for the use of the
hospital.&nbsp; Here also are the houses of the treasurer,
hospitaller, steward, cook, and butler.&nbsp; In the third court
are seven wards for men, with an apothecary&rsquo;s shop,
store-rooms and laboratory.&nbsp; In the fourth court are two
wards for women, with a surgery, hot and cold baths,
&amp;c.&nbsp; And in the year 1718 another magnificent building
was erected by the governors, containing lodgings and
conveniences for a hundred infirm persons.&nbsp; So that this
hospital is capable of containing five hundred patients and
upwards at one time; and there are between four and five thousand
people annually cured and discharged out of it, many of them
being allowed money to bear their charges to their respective
dwellings.</p>
<p>But one of the greatest charities ever attempted by a private
citizen was that of Thomas Guy, Esq., originally a bookseller of
London, and afterwards a Member of Parliament for Tamworth, who,
having acquired an immense fortune, founded a hospital for
incurables, on a spot of ground adjoining to St. Thomas&rsquo;s
Hospital, and saw the noble fabric in a good forwardness in his
lifetime, assigning about two hundred thousand pounds towards the
building, and endowing it, insomuch that it is computed there may
be an ample provision for four hundred unhappy people, who shall
be given over by physicians and surgeons as incurable.&nbsp; This
gentleman died in December, 1724, having first made his will, and
appointed trustees to see his pious design duly executed.&nbsp;
He gave also several thousand pounds to Christ&rsquo;s Hospital,
and a thousand pounds a piece to fifty of his poor relations; but
the will being in print, I refer the reader to it for a more
particular account of this noble charity.</p>
<p>The first church and hospital, dedicated to St. Thomas
&agrave; Becket, was erected by the Prior of Bermondsey, so long
since as the year 1013; but the hospital was refounded, and the
revenues increased, anno 1215, by Peter de Rupibus, Bishop of
Winchester, in whose diocese it was situated, continuing,
however, to be held of the priors of Bermondsey till the year
1428, when the Abbot of Bermondsey relinquished his interest to
the master of the hospital for a valuable consideration.&nbsp; In
the year 1538 this hospital was surrendered to King Henry VIII.,
being then valued at &pound;266 17s. 6d. per annum.&nbsp; And in
the following reign, the City of London having purchased the
buildings of the Crown, continued them a hospital for sick and
wounded people; and King Edward VI. granted them some of the
revenues of the dissolved hospitals and monasteries towards
maintaining it: but these were inconsiderable in comparison of
the large and numerous benefactions that have since been bestowed
upon it by the Lord Mayor, aldermen, and other wealthy citizens
and men of quality, governors of it, who are seldom fewer than
two or three hundred, every one of them looking upon themselves
to be under some obligation of making an addition to the revenues
of the hospital they have the direction of.&nbsp; A committee of
the governors sit every Thursday, to consider what patients are
fit to be discharged, and to admit others.</p>
<p>The government of the City of London, it is observed,
resembles that of the kingdom in general; the Lord Mayor is
compared to the king, the aldermen to the nobility or upper
house, and the common councilmen to the commons of England.</p>
<p>This assembly, consisting of the Lord Mayor, aldermen, and
common councilmen, has obtained the name of The Common Council,
and has a power, by their charters, of making such bye-laws and
statutes as are obligatory to the citizens.&nbsp; It is called
and adjourned by the Lord Mayor at pleasure, and out of it are
formed several committees, viz.&mdash;1. A committee of six
aldermen and twelve commoners for letting the City lands, which
usually meets every Wednesday at Guildhall for that end.&nbsp; 2.
A committee of four aldermen and eight commoners for letting the
lands and tenements given by Sir Thomas Gresham, who meets at
Mercers&rsquo; Hall on a summons from the Lord Mayor.&nbsp; 3.
Commissioners of Sewers and Pavements, elected annually.&nbsp;
And, 4. A governor, deputy-governor and assistants, for the
management of City lands in the province of Ulster in
Ireland.</p>
<p>The other principal courts in the City are, 1. The Court of
Aldermen.&nbsp; 2. The Court of Hustings.&nbsp; 3. The Lord
Mayor&rsquo;s Court.&nbsp; 4. The Sheriff&rsquo;s Court.&nbsp; 5.
The Chamberlain&rsquo;s Court.&nbsp; 6. The Court of the City
Orphans.&nbsp; 7. The Court of Conscience.&nbsp; 8. The Courts of
Wardmote.&nbsp; And, 9. The Courts of Hallmote.</p>
<p>Besides which, there is a Court of Oyer and Terminer and Jail
Delivery, held eight times a year at Justice Hall in the Old
Bailey, for the trial of criminals.</p>
<p>1.&nbsp; In the Lord Mayor and Court of Aldermen is lodged the
executive power in a great measure, and by these most of the city
officers are appointed, viz., the recorder, four common pleaders,
the comptroller of the chamber, the two secondaries, the
remembrancer, the city solicitor, the sword-bearer, the common
hunt, the water bailiff, four attorneys of the Lord Mayor&rsquo;s
Court, the clerk of the chamber, three sergeant carvers, three
sergeants of the chamber, the sergeant of the chanel, the two
marshals, the hall-keeper, the yeomen of the chamber, four yeomen
of the waterside, the yeoman of the chanel, the under
water-bailiff, two meal weighers, two fruit-meters, the foreign
taker, the clerk of the City works, six young men, two clerks of
the papers, eight attorneys of the Sheriff&rsquo;s Court, eight
clerks fitters, two prothonotaries, the clerk of the Bridge
House, the clerk of the Court of Requests, the beadle of the
Court of Requests, thirty-six sergeants at mace, thirty-six
yeomen, the gauger, the sealers and searchers of leather, the
keeper of the Greenyard, two keepers of the two compters, the
keeper of Newgate, the keeper of Ludgate, the measurer, the
steward of Southwark (but the bailiff of Southwark is appointed
by the Common Council) the bailiff of the hundred of Ossulston,
the City artificers, and rent-gatherer, who hath been put in by
Mr. Chamberlain.</p>
<p>In this court all leases and instruments that pass under the
City Seal are executed; the assize of bread is settled by them;
all differences relating to water-courses, lights, and
party-walls, are determined, and officers are suspended or
punished; and the aldermen, or a majority of them, have a
negative in whatever is propounded in the Common Council.</p>
<p>2.&nbsp; The Court of Hustings is esteemed the most ancient
tribunal in the City, and was established for the preservation of
the laws, franchises, and customs of it.&nbsp; It is held at
Guildhall before the Lord Mayor and Sheriffs, and in civil causes
the Recorder sits as judge.&nbsp; Here deeds are enrolled,
recoveries passed, writs of right, waste, partition, dower, and
replevins determined.</p>
<p>3.&nbsp; The Lord Mayor&rsquo;s Court, a court of record, held
in the chamber of Guildhall every Tuesday, where the Recorder
also sits as judge, and the Lord Mayor and Aldermen may sit with
him if they see fit.&nbsp; Actions of debt, trespass, arising
within the City and liberties, of any value, may be tried in this
court, and an action may be removed hither from the
Sheriff&rsquo;s Court before the jury is sworn.</p>
<p>The juries for trying causes in this and the Sheriff&rsquo;s
Courts, are returned by the several wards at their wardmote
inquests at Christmas, when each ward appoints the persons to
serve on juries for every month in the year ensuing.</p>
<p>This court is also a court of equity, and gives relief where
judgment is obtained in the Sheriff&rsquo;s Court for more than
the just debt.</p>
<p>4.&nbsp; The Sheriff&rsquo;s Courts are also courts of record,
where may be tried actions of debt, trespass, covenant,
&amp;c.&nbsp; They are held on Wednesdays and Fridays for actions
entered in Wood Street Compter, and every Thursday and Saturday
for actions entered in the Poultry Compter.&nbsp; Here the
testimony of an absent witness in writing is allowed to be good
evidence.</p>
<p>5.&nbsp; The Chamberlain&rsquo;s Court or office is held at
the chamber in Guildhall.&nbsp; He receives and pays the City
cash and orphans&rsquo; money, and keeps the securities taken by
the Court of Aldermen for the same, and annually accounts to the
auditors appointed for that purpose.&nbsp; He attends every
morning at Guildhall, to enroll or turn over apprentices, or to
make them free; and hears and determines differences between
masters and their apprentices.</p>
<p>6.&nbsp; The Court of City Orphans is held by the Lord Mayor
and Aldermen as often as occasion requires; the Common Sergeant
being entrusted by them to take all inventories and accounts of
freeman&rsquo;s estates, and the youngest attorney in the
Mayor&rsquo;s Court is clerk of the orphans, and appointed to
take security for their portions; for when any freeman dies,
leaving children under the age of twenty-one years, the clerks of
the respective parishes give in their names to the common crier,
who thereupon summons the widow or executor to appear before the
Court of Aldermen, to bring in an inventory, and give security
for the testator&rsquo;s estate, for which they commonly allow
two months&rsquo; time, and in case of non-appearance, or refusal
of security, the Lord Mayor may commit the executor to
Newgate.</p>
<p>7.&nbsp; The Court of Conscience was established for
recovering small debts under forty shillings at an easy expense,
the creditor&rsquo;s oath of the debt being sufficient without
further testimony to ascertain the debt.&nbsp; This court sits at
the hustings in Guildhall every Wednesday and Saturday, where the
Common Council of each ward are judges in their turns.&nbsp; They
proceed first by summons, which costs but sixpence, and if the
defendant appears there is no further charge; the debt is ordered
to be paid at such times and in such proportion as the court in
their consciences think the debtor able to discharge it; but if
the defendant neglect to appear, or obey the order of the court,
an attachment or execution follows with as much expedition and as
small an expense as can be supposed.&nbsp; All persons within the
freedom of the City, whether freemen or not, may prosecute and be
prosecuted in this court, and freemen may be summoned who live
out of the liberty.</p>
<p>8.&nbsp; The courts of wardmote are held by the aldermen of
each ward, for choosing ward-officers, and settling the affairs
of the ward, the Lord Mayor annually issuing his precept to the
aldermen to hold his wardmote on St. Thomas&rsquo;s Day for the
election of common councilmen and other officers; they also
present such offences and nuisances at certain times to the Lord
Mayor and common councilmen as require redress.</p>
<p>9.&nbsp; Small offences are punished by the justices in or out
of sessions, by whom the offender is sentenced to be whipped,
imprisoned, or kept to hard labour; but for the trial of capital
offences, a commission of Oyer and Terminer and jail delivery
issues eight times every year, <i>i.e.</i>, before and after
every term, directed to the Lord Mayor, Recorder, some of the
twelve judges, and others whom the Crown is pleased to
assign.&nbsp; These commissioners sit at Justice Hall in the Old
Bailey, and bills of indictment having been found by the grand
juries of London or Middlesex, containing the prisoner&rsquo;s
accusation, a petty jury, consisting of twelve substantial
citizens is empanelled for the trial of each of them; for, as to
the grand jury, they only consider whether there is such a
probability of the prisoner&rsquo;s guilt as to put him upon
making his defence, and this is determined by a majority of the
grand jury: but the petty jury, who pass upon the
prisoner&rsquo;s life and death, must all agree in their verdict,
or he cannot be convicted.&nbsp; But though the petty jury judge
of the fact, <i>i.e.</i>, what the crime is, or whether it was
committed by the prisoner or not, the commissioners or judges
declare what are the punishments appropriated to the several
species of crimes, and pronounce judgment accordingly on the
offender.&nbsp; In high treason they sentence the criminal to be
drawn upon a hurdle to the place of execution, there to be hanged
and quartered.&nbsp; In murder, robbery, and other felonies,
which are excluded the benefit of the clergy, the criminal is
sentenced to be hanged till he is dead.&nbsp; And for crimes
within the benefit of the clergy, the offender is burnt in the
hand or transported, at the discretion of the court.&nbsp; And
for petty larceny, <i>i.e.</i>, where the offender is found
guilty of theft under the value of twelve pence, he is sentenced
to be whipped.&nbsp; But a report being made to His Majesty by
the Recorder, of the circumstances with which the several capital
offences were attended, and what may be urged either in
aggravation or mitigation of them, the respective criminals are
either pardoned or executed according to His Majesty&rsquo;s
pleasure.&nbsp; But I should have remembered, that the sentence
against a woman, either for high or petty treason, is to be burnt
alive.&nbsp; I shall now give some account of the election of the
Lord Mayor, Sheriffs, &amp;c., who are chosen by a majority of
the liverymen.</p>
<p>The Lord Mayor is elected on Michaelmas Day (from among the
aldermen, by the liverymen of the City, who return two aldermen
that have served sheriffs to the Court of Aldermen for their
acceptance, who generally declare the first upon the
liverymen&rsquo;s roll to be Lord-Mayor) sworn at Guildhall on
Simon and Jude, and before the barons of the Exchequer at
Westminster the day following.</p>
<p>The Lord Mayor appears abroad in very great state at all
times, being clothed in scarlet robes, or purple richly furred,
according to the season of the year, with a hood of black velvet,
and a golden chain or collar of S.S. about his neck, and a rich
jewel pendant thereon, his officers walking before and on both
sides, his train held up, and the City sword and mace borne
before him.&nbsp; He keeps open house during his mayoralty, and
the sword-bearer is allowed &pound;1,000 for his table.&nbsp; The
Lord Mayor usually goes to St. Paul&rsquo;s, attended by the
aldermen in their gowns, and his officers, every Sunday morning;
but especially the first Sunday in term-time, where he meets the
twelve judges and invites them to dinner after divine service is
ended.</p>
<p>The sheriffs are chosen into their office on Midsummer day
annually by the liverymen also; to which end the Lord Mayor,
aldermen, and sheriffs meet in the council-chamber at Guildhall,
about eight in the morning, and coming down afterwards into the
Court of Hustings, the recorder declares to the livery men
assembled in the hall that this is the day prescribed for the
election of these magistrates for the year ensuing: then the
Court of Aldermen go up to the Lord Mayor&rsquo;s Court till the
sheriffs are chosen; the old sheriffs, the chamberlain, common
serjeant, town clerk, and other City officers remaining in the
Court of Hustings, to attend the election.&nbsp; After the
sheriffs are chosen, the commons proceed to elect a chamberlain,
bridge-masters, auditors of the city and bridge-house accounts,
and the surveyors of beer and ale, according to custom.&nbsp; The
old sheriffs are judges of these elections, and declare by the
common serjeant who are duly chosen.&nbsp; The sheriffs thus
elected take the usual oaths in this court on Michaelmas eve, and
the day after Michaelmas day are presented to the Barons of the
Exchequer, where they take the oath of office, the oaths of
allegiance, &amp;c.&nbsp; The chamberlains and bridge-masters are
sworn in the court of aldermen.</p>
<p>Where a Lord Mayor elect refuses to serve, he is liable to be
fined; and if a person chosen sheriff refuses to serve, he is
fined &pound;413 6s. 8d., unless he makes oath he is not worth
&pound;10,000.</p>
<p>When the alderman of any ward dies, another is within a few
days elected in his room, at a wardmote held for that purpose, at
which the Lord Mayor usually presides.&nbsp; Every alderman has
his deputy, who supplies his place in his absence.&nbsp; These
deputies are always taken from among the Common Council.&nbsp;
The aldermen above the chair, and the three eldest aldermen
beneath it, are justices of peace in the City by the charter.</p>
<p>The Lord-Mayor&rsquo;s jurisdiction in some cases extends a
great way beyond the City, upon the river Thames eastward as far
as the conflux of the two rivers Thames and Medway, and up the
river Lea as far as Temple Mills, being about three miles; and
westward as far as Colney Ditch above Staine Bridge: he names a
deputy called the water-bailiff, whose business is to prevent any
encroachments, nuisances, and frauds used by fishermen or others,
destructive to the fishery, or hurtful to the navigation of the
said waters; and yearly keeps courts for the conservation of the
river in the counties it borders upon within the said limits.</p>
<p>The sheriffs also are sheriffs of the county of Middlesex as
well as of London.&nbsp; And here I shall take an opportunity to
observe, that the number of aldermen are twenty-six; the number
of Common-Council men two hundred and thirty-four; the number of
companies eighty-four; and the number of citizens on the livery,
who have a voice in their elections, are computed to be between
seven and eight thousand.&nbsp; The twelve principal companies
are:&mdash;1. The Mercers; 2. Grocers; 3. Drapers; 4.
Fishmongers; 5. Goldsmiths; 6. Skinners; 7. Merchant-Tailors; 8.
Haberdashers; 9. Salters; 10. Ironmongers; 11. Vintners; 12.
Clothworkers.&nbsp; The others:&mdash;are 13. The Dyers; 14.
Brewers; 15. Leather-Sellers; 16. Pewterers; 17. Barber-Surgeons;
18. Cutlers; 19. Bakers; 20. Wax-Chandlers; 21. Tallow-Chandlers;
22. Armourers; 23. Girdlers; 24. Butchers; 25. Saddlers; 26.
Carpenters; 27. Cord-wainers; 28. Painter-stainers; 29. Curriers;
30. Masons; 31. Plumbers; 32. Innholders; 33. Founders; 34.
Poulterers; 35. Cooks; 36. Coopers; 37. Tilers and Bricklayers;
38. Bowyers; 39. Fletchers; 40. Blacksmiths; 41. Joiners; 42.
Weavers; 43. Woolmen; 44. Scriveners; 45. Fruiterers; 46.
Plasterers; 47. Stationers; 48. Embroiderers; 49. Upholders; 50.
Musicians; 51. Turners; 52. *Basket-makers; 53. Glaziers; 54.
*Horners; 55. Farriers; 56. *Paviours; 57. Lorimers; 58.
Apothecaries; 59. Shipwrights; 60. *Spectacle-makers; 61.
*Clock-makers; 62. *Glovers; 63. *Comb-makers; 64. *Felt-makers;
65. Frame-work Knitters; 66. *Silk throwers; 67. Carmen; 68.
*Pin-makers; 69. Needle-makers; 70. Gardeners; 71. Soap-makers;
72. Tin-plate Workers; 73. Wheelwrights; 74. Distillers; 75.
Hatband-makers; 76. Patten-makers; 77. Glasssellers; 78.
Tobacco-pipe makers; 79. Coach and Coach-harness makers; 80.
Gun-makers; 81. Gold and Silver Wire-Drawers; 82. Long Bow-string
makers; 83. Card-makers; 84. Fan-makers.</p>
<p>The companies marked with an * before them have no liverymen,
and all the freemen of the rest are not upon the livery, that is,
entitled to wear the gowns belonging to the respective companies,
and vote in elections, but a select number of freemen only.&nbsp;
Every company is a distinct corporation, being incorporated by
grants from the crown, or acts of parliament, and having certain
rules, liberties, and privileges, for the better support and
government of their several trades and mysteries: many of them
are endowed with lands to a great value, and have their masters,
wardens, assistants, clerks, and other officers, to direct and
regulate their affairs, and to restrain and punish abuses
incident to their several trades; and when any disputes arise
concerning the due execution of these charters, the Lord Mayor
has a supreme power to determine the case and to punish the
offenders.</p>
<p>The military government of the City of London is lodged in the
lieutenancy, consisting of the Lord Mayor, aldermen, and other
principal citizens, who receive their authority from his
majesty&rsquo;s commission, which he revokes and alters as often
as he sees fit.&nbsp; These have under their command six
regiments of foot, viz.:&mdash;1, The White; 2, the Orange; 3,
the Yellow; 4, the Blue; 5, the Green; and 6, the Red
Regiment&mdash;in every one of which are eight companies,
consisting of one hundred and fifty men each; in all, seven
thousand two hundred men: besides which there is a kind of
independent company, called the artillery company, consisting of
seven or eight hundred volunteers, whose skill in military
discipline is much admired by their fellow-citizens.&nbsp; These
exercise frequently in the artillery ground, engage in mock
fights and sieges, and storm the dunghills with great
address.</p>
<p>The Tower Hamlets, it has been observed already, are commanded
by the lieutenant of the Tower, and consist of two regiments of
foot, eight hundred each: so that the whole militia of London,
exclusive of Westminster and Southwark, amount to near ten
thousand men.</p>
<p>London, like other cities of the kingdom, is, or ought to be,
governed by its bishop in spirituals, though his authority is
very little regarded at present.&nbsp; The justices of peace at
their sessions may empower any man to preach and administer the
sacraments, let his occupation or qualifications be never so
mean; nor do they ever refuse it to a person who is able to raise
the small sum of &mdash; pence being less a great deal than is
paid for licensing a common alehouse.&nbsp; A clergyman indeed
cannot be entitled to a benefice without being, in some measure,
subject to his diocesan; but he may throw off his gown, and
assemble a congregation that shall be much more beneficial to
him, and propagate what doctrines he sees fit (as is evident in
the case of orator Henley): but to proceed.</p>
<p>The diocese of London is in the province of Canterbury, and
comprehends the counties of Middlesex and Essex, and part of
Hertfordshire; the British plantations in America are also
subject to this bishop.&nbsp; To the cathedral of St. Paul
belongs a dean, three residentiaries, a treasurer, chancellor,
precentor, and thirty prebendaries.&nbsp; The Bishop of London
takes place next to the Archbishops of Canterbury and York, but
his revenues are not equal to those of Durham or
Winchester.&nbsp; The deanery of St. Paul&rsquo;s is said to be
worth a thousand pounds per annum, and each of the residentiaries
about three hundred pounds per annum.</p>
<p>The parishes within the walls of London are ninety-seven; but
several of them having been united since the Fire, there are at
present but sixty-two parish churches, and consequently the same
number of parish priests: the revenues of these gentlemen are
seldom less than &pound;100 per annum, and none more than
&pound;200 per annum.&nbsp; They appear to be most of them about
&pound;150 per annum, besides their several parsonage houses and
surplice fees; and most of them have lectureships in town, or
livings in the country, or some other spiritual preferment of
equal value.</p>
<p>The city of Westminster, the western part of the town, comes
next under consideration which received its name from the abbey
or minster situated to the westward of London.&nbsp; This city,
if we comprehend the district or liberties belonging to it, lies
along the banks of the Thames in the form of a bow or crescent,
extending from Temple Bar in the east to Millbank in the
south-west; the inside of this bow being about a mile and a half
in length, and the outside two miles and a half at least; the
breadth, one place with another, from the Thames to the fields on
the north-west side of the town, about a mile; and I am apt to
think a square of two miles in length and one in breadth would
contain all the buildings within the liberty of
Westminster.&nbsp; That part of the town which is properly called
the city of Westminster contains no more than St.
Margaret&rsquo;s and St. John&rsquo;s parishes, which form a
triangle, one side whereof extends from Whitehall to Peterborough
House on Millbank; another side reaches from Peterborough House
to Stafford House, or Tart Hall, at the west end of the park; and
the third side extends from Stafford house to Whitehall; the
circumference of the whole being about two miles.&nbsp; This spot
of ground, it is said, was anciently an island, a branch of the
Thames running through the park from west to east, and falling
into the main river again about Whitehall, which island was
originally called Thorney Island, from the woods and bushes that
covered it; the abbey or minster also was at first called Thorney
Abbey or minster, from the island on which it stood.</p>
<p>St. James&rsquo;s Park is something more than a mile in
circumference, and the form pretty near oval; about the middle of
it runs a canal 2,800 feet in length and 100 in breadth, and near
it are several other waters, which form an island that has good
cover for the breeding and harbouring wild ducks and other
water-fowl; on the island also is a pretty house and garden,
scarce visible to the company in the park.&nbsp; On the north
side are several fine walks of elms and limes half a mile in
length, of which the Mall is one.&nbsp; The palace of St.
James&rsquo;s, Marlborough House, and the fine buildings in the
street called Pall Mall, adorn this side of the park.&nbsp; At
the east end is a view of the Admiralty, a magnificent edifice,
lately built with brick and stone; the Horse Guards, the
Banqueting House, the most elegant fabric in the kingdom, with
the Treasury and the fine buildings about the Cockpit; and
between these and the end of the grand canal is a spacious
parade, where the horse and foot guards rendezvous every morning
before they mount their respective guards.</p>
<p>On the south side of the park run shady walks of trees from
east to west, parallel almost to the canal, and walks on the
north; adjoining to which are the sumptuous houses in Queen
Street, Queen Square, &amp;c., inhabited by people of quality:
and the west end of the park is adorned with the Duke of
Buckingham&rsquo;s beautiful seat.&nbsp; But what renders St.
James&rsquo;s Park one of the most delightful scenes in Nature is
the variety of living objects which is met with here; for besides
the deer and wild fowl, common to other parks, besides the water,
fine walks, and the elegant buildings that surround it, hither
the politest part of the British nation of both sexes frequently
resort in the spring to take the benefit of the evening air, and
enjoy the most agreeable conversation imaginable; and those who
have a taste for martial music, and the shining equipage of the
soldiery, will find their eyes and ears agreeably entertained by
the horse and foot guards every morning.</p>
<p>The Sanctuary, or the abbey-yard, is a large open square,
between King Street and the Gate-house, north-west of the abbey,
and was called the Sanctuary, because any person who came within
these limits was entitled to the privilege of
sanctuary&mdash;that is, he was not liable to be apprehended by
any officers of justice.</p>
<p>This privilege, it is said, was first granted to the abbey by
Sebert, king of the East Saxons, increased by King Edgar, and
confirmed by Edward the Confessor, by the following
charter:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Edward, by the grace of God, king of Englishmen; I make
it to be known to all generations of the world after me, that, by
special commandment of our holy father Pope Leo, I have renewed
and honoured the holy church of the blessed apostle St. Peter of
Westminster; and I order and establish for ever, that what
person, of what condition or estate soever he be, from
whencesoever he come, or for what offence or cause it be, either
for his refuge in the said holy place, he is assured of his life,
liberty, and limbs: and over this, I forbid, under pain of
everlasting damnation, that no minister of mine, or any of my
successors, intermeddle with any of the goods, lands, and
possessions of the said persons taking the said sanctuary: for I
have taken their goods and livelode into my special
protection.&nbsp; And therefore I grant to every, each of them,
in as much as my terrestrial power may suffice, all manner of
freedom of joyous liberty.&nbsp; And whosoever presumes, or doth
contrary to this my grant, I will he lose his name, worship,
dignity, and power; and that with the great traitor Judas that
betrayed our Saviour, he be in the everlasting fire of
hell.&nbsp; And I will and ordain, that this my grant endure as
long as there remaineth in England either love or dread of
Christian name.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This privilege of sanctuary, as far as it related to traitors,
murderers, and felons, was in a great measure abolished by a
statute of the 32nd Henry VIII.: and in the beginning of the
reign of Queen Elizabeth, every debtor who fled to sanctuary, to
shelter himself from his creditors, was obliged to take an oath
of the following tenor, viz.:&mdash;That he did not claim the
privilege of sanctuary to defraud any one of his goods, debts, or
money, but only for the security of his person until he should be
able to pay his creditors.</p>
<p>That he would give in a true particular of his debts and
credits.</p>
<p>That he would endeavour to pay his debts as soon as
possible.</p>
<p>That he would be present at the abbey at morning and evening
prayer.</p>
<p>That he would demean himself honestly and quietly, avoid
suspected houses, unlawful games, banqueting, and riotous
company.</p>
<p>That he would wear no weapon, or be out of his lodging before
sunrise or after sunset, nor depart out of the precinct of the
sanctuary without the leave of the dean, or archdeacon in his
absence.</p>
<p>That he would be obedient to the dean and the officers of the
house.</p>
<p>And lastly, that if he should break his oath in any
particular, he should not claim the privilege of sanctuary.</p>
<p>And if any creditor could make it appear that he had any
money, goods, or chattels that were not contained in the
particular given in to the dean and the church, the sanctuary man
was to be imprisoned till he came to an agreement with his
creditors.</p>
<p>The Abbey-Church of St. Peter at Westminster appears to be
very ancient, though far from being so ancient as is vulgarly
reported.</p>
<p>Some relate, without any authority to support the conjecture,
that it was founded in the days of the Apostles by St. Peter
himself; others that it was erected by King Lucius about the year
170.&nbsp; And by some it is said to have been built by King
Sebert, the first Christian king of the East-Saxons (Essex and
Middlesex), anno 611.&nbsp; But I take it for granted the church
was not built before the convent or abbey it belonged to.&nbsp;
People did not use to build churches at a distance from town,
unless for the service of convents or religious houses.&nbsp; But
neither in the times of the Apostles, nor in the supposed reign
of King Lucius, in the second century, was there any such thing
as a convent in England, or perhaps in any part of
Christendom.&nbsp; During the dominion of the Saxons in this
island, monasteries indeed were erected here, and in many other
kingdoms, in great abundance; and as the monks generally chose
thick woods or other solitary places for their residence, where
could they meet with a spot of ground fitter for their purpose
than this woody island called Thorney, then destitute of
inhabitants?&nbsp; But I am inclined to think that neither this
or any other monastery was erected in South Britain till the
seventh century, after Austin the monk came into England.&nbsp;
As to the tradition of its having been built upon the ruins of
the temple of Apollo, destroyed by an earthquake, I do not doubt
but the monks were very ready to propagate a fable of this kind,
who formed so many others to show the triumphs of Christianity
over paganism, and to induce their proselytes to believe that
heaven miraculously interposed in their favour by earthquakes,
storms, and other prodigies.&nbsp; But to proceed.&nbsp; When the
convent was erected, I make no doubt that there was a church or
chapel built as usual for the service of the monks; but it is
evident from history that the dimensions of the first or second
church that stood here were not comparable to those of the
present church.</p>
<p>We may rely upon it that about the year 850 there was a church
and convent in the island of Thorney, because about that time,
London being in the possession of the Danes, the convent was
destroyed by them (not in the year 659, as some writers have
affirmed, because the Danes did not invade England till nearly
200 years afterwards).&nbsp; The abbey lay in ruins about a
hundred years, when King Edgar, at the instance of Dunstan, Abbot
of Glastonbury (and afterwards Archbishop of Canterbury), rebuilt
this and several other monasteries, about the year 960.&nbsp;
Edward the Confessor, a devout prince, enlarged this church and
monastery, in which he placed the Benedictine monks, ordered the
regalia to be kept by the fathers of the convent, and succeeding
kings to be crowned here, as William the Conqueror and several
other English monarchs afterwards were, most of them enriching
this abbey with large revenues; but King Henry III. ordered the
church built by Edward the Confessor to be pulled down, and
erected the present magnificent fabric in the room of it, of
which he laid the first stone about the year 1245.</p>
<p>That admired piece of architecture at the east end, dedicated
to the Virgin Mary, was built by Henry VII., anno 1502, and from
the founder is usually called Henry the VII.&rsquo;s
Chapel.&nbsp; Here most of the English monarchs since that time
have been interred.</p>
<p>The dimensions of the abbey-church, according to the new
survey, are as follows, viz.:&mdash;The length of the church,
from the west end of it to the east end of St. Edward&rsquo;s
Chapel, is 354 feet; the breadth of the west end, 66 feet; the
breadth of the cross aisle, from north to south, 189 feet; the
height of the middle roof, 92 feet; the distance from the west
end of the church to the choir, 162 feet; and from the west end
to the cross aisle, 220 feet; the distance from the east end of
St. Edward&rsquo;s Chapel to the west end of Henry VII.&rsquo;s
Chapel, 36 feet; and the length of Henry VII.&rsquo;s Chapel, 99
feet: so that the length of the whole building is 489 feet; the
breadth of Henry VII.&rsquo;s Chapel, 66 feet; and the height, 54
feet.&nbsp; The nave and cross aisles of the abbey-church are
supported by fifty slender pillars, of Sussex marble, besides
forty-five demi-pillars or pilasters.&nbsp; There are an upper
and lower range of windows, being ninety-four in number, those at
the four ends of the cross very spacious.&nbsp; All which, with
the arches, roofs, doors, &amp;c., are of the ancient Gothic
order.&nbsp; Above the chapiters the pillars spread into several
semi-cylindrical branches, forming and adorning the arches of the
pillars, and those of the roofs of the aisles, which are three in
number, running from east to west, and a cross aisle running from
north to south.&nbsp; The choir is paved with black and white
marble, in which are twenty-eight stalls on the north side, as
many on the fourth, and eight at the west end; from the choir we
ascend by several steps to a most magnificent marble altarpiece,
which would be esteemed a beauty in an Italian church.</p>
<p>Beyond the altar is King Edward the Confessor&rsquo;s Chapel,
surrounded with eleven or twelve other chapels replenished with
monuments of the British nobility, for a particular whereof I
refer the reader to the &ldquo;Antiquities of St. Peter, or the
Abbey-Church of Westminster,&rdquo; by J. Crull, M.D. Lond. 1711,
8vo, and the several supplements printed since; and shall only
take notice of those of the kings and queens in the chapel of St.
Edward the Confessor, which are as follows, viz., Edward I., King
of England; Henry III.; Matilda, wife of Henry I.; Queen Eleanor,
wife of Edward I.; St. Edward the Confessor, and Queen Editha,
his wife; Henry V., and Queen Catherine of Valois, his wife;
Edward III., and Queen Philippa, his wife; Richard II., and Queen
Anne, his wife.&nbsp; And on the south side of the choir, King
Sebert, and Queen Anne of Cheve, wife to Henry VIII.&nbsp; East
of St. Edward&rsquo;s Chapel is that of Henry VII., dedicated to
the blessed Virgin Mary, to which we ascend by twelve stone
steps.&nbsp; At the west end whereof are three brazen doors
finely wrought, which give an entrance into it.&nbsp; The stalls
on the north and south sides are exquisitely carved.&nbsp; The
roof is supported by twelve pillars and arches of the Gothic
order, abounding with enrichments of carved figures, fruit,
&amp;c.&nbsp; At the east end is a spacious window with stained
glass, besides which there are thirteen other windows above, and
as many below on the north and south sides.&nbsp; Under each of
the thirteen uppermost windows are five figures placed in niches,
representing kings, queens, bishops, &amp;c., and under them the
figures of as many angels supporting imperial crowns.&nbsp; The
roof, which is all stone, is divided into sixteen circles,
curiously wrought, and is the admiration of all that see it.</p>
<p>The outside of this chapel was adorned with fourteen towers,
three figures being placed in niches on each of them, which were
formerly much admired; but the stone decaying and mouldering
away, they make but an odd appearance at present.</p>
<p>In this chapel have been interred most of the English kings
since Richard III., whose tombs are no small ornament to it,
particularly that of Henry VII., the founder, which stands in the
middle of the area towards the east end.</p>
<p>The tomb is composed of a curious pedestal whose sides are
adorned with various figures, as the north with those of six men,
the east with those of two cupids supporting the king&rsquo;s
arms and an imperial crown; on the south side, also, six figures,
circumscribed&mdash;as those on the north side&mdash;with circles
of curious workmanship, the most easterly of which contains the
figure of an angel treading on a dragon.&nbsp; Here is also a
woman and a child, seeming to allude to Rev. xii.; and on the
west end the figure of a rose and an imperial crown, supported
with those of a dragon and a greyhound: on the tomb are the
figures of the king and queen, lying at full length, with four
angels, one at each angle of the tomb, all very finely done in
brass.</p>
<p>The screen or fence is also of solid brass, very strong and
spacious, being in length 19 feet, in breadth 11, and the
altitude 11, adorned with forty-two pillars and their arches;
also, twenty smaller hollow columns and their arches in the front
of the former, and joined at the cornice, on which cornice is a
kind of acroteria, enriched with roses and portcullises
interchanged in the upper part, and with the small figures of
dragons and greyhounds (the supporters aforesaid) in the lower
part; and at each of the four angles is a strong pillar made
open, or hollow, composed in imitation of diaper and Gothic
archwork; the four sides have been adorned with thirty-two
figures of men, about a cubit high, placed in niches, of which
there are only seven left, the rest being stolen away (one
Raymond, about the 11th of Queen Elizabeth, having been twice
indicted for the same); and about the middle of the upper part of
each of the four sides is a spacious branch adorned with the
figure of a rose, where might on occasion be placed lamps.&nbsp;
This admirable piece of art is open at top, and has two portals,
one on the north, the other on the south side, all of fine
brass.</p>

<p>The modern tombs in the abbey, best worth the viewing, are
those of the duke of Newcastle, on the left hand as we enter the
north door, of Sir Isaac Newton, at the west end of the choir, of
Sir Godfrey Kneller, and Mr. Secretary Craggs at the west end of
the abbey, of Mr. Prior among the poets at the door which faces
the Old Palace Yard, of the Duke of Buckingham in Henry
VII.th&rsquo;s chapel, and that of Doctor Chamberlain on the
North side of the choir: most of these are admirable pieces of
sculpture, and show that the statuary&rsquo;s art is not entirely
lost in this country; though it must be confessed the English
fall short of the Italians in this science.</p>
<p>Westminster Hall is one of the largest rooms in Europe, being
two hundred and twenty-eight feet in length, fifty-six feet
broad, and ninety feet high.&nbsp; The walls are of stone, the
windows of the Gothic form, the floor stone, and the roof of
timber covered with lead; and having not one pillar in it, is
supported by buttresses.&nbsp; It is usually observed that there
are no cobwebs ever seen in this hall, and the reason given for
this is, that the timber of which the roof is composed is Irish
oak, in which spiders will not harbour; but I am inclined to
believe that this is a fact not to be depended on, for I find the
timber for rebuilding and repairing the Palace of Westminster in
the reign of Richard III. was brought from the forests in Essex;
and as there is no colour from history to surmise that the timber
of this hall was Irish oak, so is there no imaginable reason why
timber should be fetched from another kingdom for the repair of
the hall, when the counties of Middlesex and Essex were great
part of them forest, and afforded timber enough to have built
twenty such places; and we find that the timber of the Essex
forests was in fact applied to the repairs of this palace; for it
cannot be pretended that the present roof is the same that was
erected by William Rufus when it was first built, it appearing
that Richard II., about the year 1397, caused the old roof to be
taken down and a new one made (as has been observed already) and
this is probably the same we now see.&nbsp; Here are hung up as
trophies, 138 colours, and 34 standards, taken from the French
and Bavarians at Hochstadt, anno 1704.</p>
<p>The House of Lords, or chamber where the peers assemble in
Parliament, is situated between the Old Palace Yard and the
Thames.&nbsp; It is a spacious room, of an oblong form, at the
south end whereof is the King&rsquo;s throne, to which he ascends
by several steps: on the right hand of the throne is a seat for
the Prince of Wales, and on the left another for the princes of
the blood, and behind the throne the seats of the peers under
age.</p>
<p>On the east side of the house, to the right of the throne, sit
the archbishops and bishops; on the opposite side of the house
sit the dukes, marquises, earls, and viscounts; and on forms
crossing the area, the barons under the degree of viscounts.</p>
<p>Before the throne are three wool-sacks, or broad seats stuffed
with wool, to put the Legislature in mind, it is said, that the
right management of this trade is of the last importance to the
kingdom.&nbsp; On the first of these wool-sacks, next to the
throne, sits the Lord Chancellor, or Keeper, who is Speaker of
the House of Peers; and on the other two, the Lord Chief Justices
and the rest of the judges, with the Master of the Rolls, and the
other Masters in Chancery: about the middle of the house, on the
east side, is a chimney, where a fire is usually kept in the
winter; and towards the north, or lower end of the house, is a
bar that runs across it, to which the commons advance when they
bring up bills or impeachments, or when the King sends for them,
and without this bar the council and witnesses stand at trials
before the peers.&nbsp; The house is at present hung with
tapestry, containing the history of the defeat of the Spanish
Armada, in the reign of Queen Elizabeth, anno 1588.</p>
<p>The house or chamber where the commons assemble is to the
northward of the House of Lords, and stands east and west, as the
other does north and south.&nbsp; The room is pretty near square,
and towards the upper end is the Speaker&rsquo;s armed chair, to
which he ascends by a step or two; before it is a table where the
clerks sit, on which the mace lies when the Speaker is in the
chair, and at other times the mace is laid under the table.&nbsp;
On the north and south sides, and at the west end, are seats
gradually ascending as in a theatre, and between the seats at the
west end is the entrance by a pair of folding-doors.&nbsp; There
are galleries also on the north, south, and west, where strangers
are frequently admitted to hear the debates.</p>
<p>This room was anciently a chapel, founded by King Stephen
about the year 1141, and dedicated to the Blessed Virgin;
however, it obtained the name of St. Stephen&rsquo;s
Chapel.&nbsp; It was rebuilt by King Edward III., anno 1347, who
placed in it a dean, twelve secular canons, thirteen vicars, four
clerks, five choristers, a verger, and a keeper of the chapel,
and built them a convent, which extended along the Thames,
endowing it with large revenues, which at the dissolution of
monasteries in the reign of Edward VI. amounted to near eleven
thousand pounds per annum.&nbsp; Almost ever since the
dissolution, this chapel has been converted to the use we find it
at present, viz., for the session of the Lower House of
Parliament, who, before that time, usually assembled in the
chapter-house belonging to the Abbey, when the Parliament met at
Westminster.&nbsp; The Painted Chamber lies between the House of
Lords and the House of Commons, and here the committees of both
houses usually meet at a conference; but neither this nor the
other remaining apartments of this Palace of Westminster have
anything in them that merit a particular description.</p>
<p>The open place usually called Charing Cross, from a fine cross
which stood there before the grand rebellion, is of a triangular
form, having the Pall Mall and the Haymarket on the north-west,
the Strand on the east, and the street before Whitehall on the
south.&nbsp; In the middle of this space is erected a brazen
equestrian statue of King Charles I., looking towards the place
where that prince was murdered by the rebels, who had erected a
scaffold for that purpose before the gates of his own
palace.&nbsp; This statue is erected on a stone pedestal
seventeen feet high, enriched with his Majesty&rsquo;s arms,
trophy-work, palm-branches, &amp;c., enclosed with an iron
palisade, and was erected by King Charles II. after his
restoration.&nbsp; The brick buildings south-east of Charing
Cross are mostly beautiful and uniform, and the King&rsquo;s
stables in the Mews, which lie north of it, and are now
magnificently rebuilding of hewn stone, will probably make
Charing Cross as fine a place as any we have in town; especially
as it stands upon an eminence overlooking Whitehall.</p>
<p>The Banqueting-house stands on the east side of the street
adjoining to the great gate of Whitehall on the south.&nbsp; This
edifice is built of hewn stone, and consists of one stately room,
of an oblong form, upwards of forty feet in height, the length
and breadth proportionable, having galleries round it on the
inside, the ceiling beautifully painted by that celebrated
history-painter, Sir Peter Paul Rubens: it is adorned on the
outside with a lower and upper range of columns of the Ionic and
Composite orders, their capitals enriched with fruit, foliage,
&amp;c., the intercolumns of the upper and lower range being
handsome sashed windows.&nbsp; It is surrounded on the top with
stone rails or banisters, and covered with lead.</p>
<p>St. James&rsquo;s Palace, where the Royal Family now resides
in the winter season, stands pleasantly upon the north side of
the Park, and has several noble rooms in it, but is an irregular
building, by no means suitable to the grandeur of the British
monarch its master.&nbsp; In the front next St. James&rsquo;s
Street there appears little more than an old gate-house, by which
we enter a little square court, with a piazza on the west side of
it leading to the grand staircase; and there are two other courts
beyond, which have not much the air of a prince&rsquo;s
palace.&nbsp; This palace was a hospital, suppressed by Henry
VIII., who built this edifice in the room of it.</p>
<p>But the house most admired for its situation is that of the
Duke of Buckingham at the west end of the Park; in the front of
which, towards the Mall and the grand canal, is a spacious court,
the offices on each side having a communication with the house by
two little bending piazzas and galleries that form the
wings.&nbsp; This front is adorned with two ranges of pilasters
of the Corinthian and Tuscan orders, and over them is an
acroteria of figures, representing Mercury, Secrecy, Equity, and
Liberty, and under them this inscription in large golden
characters, <i>viz.</i>, <span class="smcap">Sic siti
L&aelig;tantvr Lares</span> (Thus situated, may the household
gods rejoice).</p>
<p>Behind the house is a fine garden and terrace, from whence
there is prospect adjacent on the house on that side, viz., <span
class="smcap">Rvs in Vrbe</span>, intimating that it has the
advantages both of city and country; above which are figures
representing the four seasons: The hall is paved with marble, and
adorned with pilasters, the intercolumns exquisite paintings in
great variety; and on a pedestal, near the foot of the grand
staircase, is a marble figure of Cain killing his brother Abel;
the whole structure exceeding magnificent, rich, and beautiful,
but especially in the finishing and furniture.</p>
<p>Grosvenor or Gravenor Square is bounded on the north by Oxford
Road, on the east by Hanover Square, by Mayfair on the south, and
by Hyde Park on the west; the area whereof contains about five
acres of ground, in which is a large garden laid out into walks,
and adorned with an equestrian statue of King George I. gilded
with gold, and standing on a pedestal, in the centre of the
garden, the whole surrounded with palisades placed upon a dwarf
wall.&nbsp; The buildings generally are the most magnificent we
meet with in this great town; though the fronts of the houses are
not all alike, for some of them are entirely of stone, others of
brick and stone, and others of rubbed brick, with only their
quoins, fascias, windows, and door-cases of stone; some of them
are adorned with stone columns of the several orders, while
others have only plain fronts; but they are so far uniform as to
be all sashed, and of pretty near an equal height.&nbsp; To the
kitchens and offices, which have little paved yards with vaults
before them, they descend by twelve or fifteen steps, and these
yards are defended by a high palisade of iron.&nbsp; Every house
has a garden behind it, and many of them coach-houses and stables
adjoining; and others have stables near the square, in a place
that has obtained the name of Grosvenor Mews.&nbsp; The finishing
of the houses within is equal to the figure they make without;
the staircases of some of them I saw were inlaid, and perfect
cabinet-work, and the paintings on the roof and sides by the best
hands.&nbsp; The apartments usually consist of a long range of
fine rooms, equally commodious and beautiful; none of the houses
are without two or three staircases for the convenience of the
family.&nbsp; The grand staircase is generally in the hall or
saloon at the entrance.&nbsp; In short, this square may well be
looked upon as the beauty of the town, and those who have not
seen it cannot have an adequate idea of the place.</p>
<p>The city of Westminster at this day consists of the parishes
of St. Margaret and St. John the Evangelist, and the liberties of
Westminster, viz., St. Martin&rsquo;s-in-the-Fields; St. Mary le
Savoy; St. Mary le Strand; St. Clement&rsquo;s Danes; St.
Paul&rsquo;s, Covent Garden; St. James&rsquo;s, Westminster; St.
George&rsquo;s, Hanover Square; and St. Anne&rsquo;s,
Westminster; all under the government of the dean and chapter of
Westminster, and their subordinate officers; or rather, of a high
steward, and such other officers as are appointed by them; for
since the Reformation, the dean and chapter seem to have
delegated their civil power to such officers as they elect for
life, who are not accountable to, or liable to be displaced by
them, nor are they liable to forfeit their offices, but for such
offences as a private man may lose his estate, namely, for high
treason, felony, &amp;c., as happened in the case of their high
steward, the Duke of Ormond, upon whose attainder the dean and
chapter proceeded to a new election.</p>
<p>The next officer to the high steward is the deputy steward,
appointed by the high steward, and confirmed by the dean and
chapter, who is usually a gentleman learned in the law, being
judge of their court for trial of civil actions between party and
party, which is held usually on Wednesday every week.&nbsp; They
have also a court-leet, held annually on St. Thomas&rsquo;s Day,
for the choice of officers, and removal of nuisances.&nbsp; The
deputy-steward supplies the place of sheriff of Westminster,
except in the return of members of Parliament, which is done by
the high bailiff, an officer nominated by the dean and chapter,
and confirmed by the high steward.&nbsp; The high-bailiff also is
entitled to all fines, forfeitures, waifs and strays in
Westminster, which makes it a very profitable post.</p>
<p>The high constable, chosen by the burgesses at their
court-leet, and approved by the steward or his deputy, is an
officer of some consideration in this city also, to whom all the
rest of the constables are subject.</p>
<p>The burgesses are sixteen in number, seven for the city and
nine for the liberties of Westminster, appointed by the high
steward or his deputy, every one of whom has his assistant, and
has particular wards or districts: out of these burgesses are
chosen two chief burgesses, one for the city, the other for the
liberties.&nbsp; The dean, high steward, or his deputy, the
bailiffs and burgesses, or a quorum of them, are empowered to
make bye-laws, and take cognisance of small offences, within the
city and liberties of Westminster.&nbsp; But I look upon it that
the justices of peace for Westminster have in a great measure
superseded the authority of the burgesses (except as to weights,
measures, and nuisances), by virtue of whose warrants all petty
offenders almost are apprehended and sent to Tothill Fields
Bridewell; and for higher offences, the same justices commit
criminals to Newgate, or the Gatehouse, who receive their trials
before commissioners of <i>oyer</i> and <i>terminer</i> at the
Old Bailey, as notorious criminals in the City of London do; and
so far the two united cities may be said to be under the same
government.</p>
<p>The precinct of St. Martin&rsquo;s-le-Grand, in London, is
deemed a part of the city of Westminster, and the inhabitants
vote in the elections of members of Parliament for
Westminster.</p>
<p>The ecclesiastical government of the city of Westminster is in
the dean, and chapter, whose commissary has the jurisdiction in
all ecclesiastical causes, and the probate of wills; from whom
there lies no appeal to the Archbishop of Canterbury or other
spiritual judge, but to the King in Chancery alone, who upon such
appeal issues a commission under the Great Seal of England,
constituting a court of delegates to determine the cause
finally.</p>
<p>I next proceed to survey the out-parishes in the Counties of
Middlesex and Surrey which are comprehended within the bills of
mortality, and esteemed part of this great town.&nbsp; And first,
St. Giles&rsquo;s in the Fields contains these chief streets and
places: Great Lincoln&rsquo;s Inn Fields, part of Lincoln&rsquo;s
Inn Garden, Turnstile, Whetstone Park, part of High Holborn, part
of Duke Street, Old and New Wild Street, Princes Street, Queen
Street, part of Drury Lane, Brownlow Street, Bolton Street,
Castle Street, King Street, the Seven Dials, or seven streets
comprehending Earl Street, Queen Street, White Lion Street, and
St. Andrew&rsquo;s Street, Monmouth Street, the east side of Hog
Lane, Stedwell Street, and Staig Street.</p>
<p>Great Lincoln&rsquo;s Inn Fields or Square contains about ten
acres of ground, and is something longer than it is broad, the
longest sides extending from east to west.&nbsp; The buildings on
the west and south generally make a grand figure.</p>
<p>In the parish of St. Sepulchre, which is without the liberties
of the City of London, we meet with Hicks&rsquo;s Hall and the
Charter House.</p>
<p>Hicks&rsquo;s Hall is situated in the middle of St.
John&rsquo;s Street, towards the south end, and is the sessions
house for the justices of peace of the County of Middlesex,
having been erected for this end, anno 1612, by Sir Baptist
Hicks, a mercer in Cheapside, then a justice of the peace.&nbsp;
The justices before holding their sessions at the Castle Inn,
near Smithfield Bars.</p>
<p>To the eastward of Hicks&rsquo;s Hall stood the late dissolved
monastery of the Charter House, founded by Sir Walter Manny, a
native of the Low Countries, knighted by King Edward III. for
services done to this crown, probably in the wars against
France.</p>
<p>Sir Walter Manny at first erected only a chapel, and assigned
it to be the burial-place of all strangers; but in the year 1371
Sir Walter founded a monastery of Carthusian monks here,
transferring to these fathers thirteen acres and a rood of land
with the said chapel: the revenues of which convent, on the
dissolution of monasteries, 30 Henry VIII., amounted to
&pound;642 4d. 1ob. per annum.</p>
<p>Sir Thomas Audley soon after obtained a grant of this
Carthusian monastery, together with Duke&rsquo;s Place, and gave
the former in marriage with his daughter Margaret to Thomas, Duke
of Norfolk, from whom it descended to the Earl of Suffolk, and
was called Howard House, the surname of that noble family.&nbsp;
By which name Thomas Sutton, Esq., purchased it of the Earl of
Suffolk for &pound;13,000, anno 1611, and converted it into a
hospital by virtue of letters patent obtained from King James I.,
which were afterwards confirmed by Act of Parliament, 3 Charles
I.</p>

<p>But the revenues now amount to upwards of &pound;6,000 per
annum by the improvement of the rents.&nbsp; This charity was
given for the maintenance of fourscore old men, who were to be
either gentlemen by descent reduced to poverty, soldiers by sea
or land, merchants who had suffered by piracy or shipwreck, or
servants of the King&rsquo;s household, and were to be fifty
years of age and upwards at their admission, except maimed
soldiers, who are capable of being admitted at forty years of
age.&nbsp; Nor are any to be admitted who are afflicted with
leprosy, or any unclean or infectious disease, or who shall be
possessed of the value of &pound;200, or &pound;14 per annum for
life, or who are married men.&nbsp; No poor brother to go beyond
sea without the licence of six of the governors, nor to go into
the country for above two months without the master&rsquo;s
leave, and during such absence shall be allowed but two-thirds of
his commons in money besides his salary; and if a brother go out
and is arrested he shall have no allowance during his absence,
but his place to be reserved till the governors&rsquo; pleasure
be known.</p>
<p>No brother to pass the gates of the hospital in his livery
gown, or to lie out of the house, or solicit causes, or molest
any of the King&rsquo;s subjects, under a certain pecuniary pain;
and all other duties, such as frequenting chapel, decent clothing
and behaviour, to be regulated by the governors.</p>
<p>This munificent benefactor also founded a grammar school in
the Charter House, to consist of a master, usher, and forty
scholars.</p>
<p>No scholars to be admitted at above fourteen or under ten
years of age.</p>
<p>The scholars are habited in black gowns, and when any of them
are fit for the university, and are elected, each of them
receives &pound;20 per annum for eight years out of the revenues
of the house.&nbsp; And such boys who are found more fit for
trades are bound out, and a considerable sum of money given with
them.</p>
<p>When any of the forty boys are disposed of, or any of the old
men die, others are placed in their rooms by the governors in
their turns.</p>
<p>The master is to be an unmarried man, aged about forty; one
that hath no preferment in Church or State which may draw him
from his residence and care of the hospital.</p>
<p>The preacher must be a Master of Arts, of seven years&rsquo;
standing in one of the universities of England, and one who has
preached four years.</p>
<p>The governors meet in December, to take the year&rsquo;s
accounts, view the state of the hospital, and to determine other
affairs; and again in June or July, to dispose of the scholars to
the university or trades, make elections, &amp;c.&nbsp; And a
committee of five at the least is appointed at the assembly in
December yearly, to visit the school between Easter and
Midsummer, &amp;c.</p>
<p>The buildings of the Charter House take up a great deal of
ground, and are commodious enough, but have no great share of
beauty.&nbsp; This house has pretty much the air of a college or
monastery, of which the principal rooms are the chapel and the
hall; and the old men who are members of the society have their
several cells, as the monks have in Portugal.</p>
<p>The chapel is built of brick and boulder, and is about
sixty-three feet in length, thirty-eight in breadth, and
twenty-four in height.&nbsp; Here Sir William Manny, founder of
the Carthusian monastery, was buried; and here was interred Mr.
Sutton, the founder of the hospital, whose monument is at the
north-east angle of the chapel, being of black and white marble,
adorned with four columns, with pedestals and entablature of the
Corinthian order, between which lies his effigy at length in a
fur gown, his face upwards and the palms of his hands joined over
his breast; and on the tomb is the following
inscription:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Sacred to the glory of God, in grateful
memory of Thomas Sutton, Esq.&nbsp; Here lieth buried the body of
Thomas Sutton, late of Castle Camps, in the County of Cambridge,
Esq., at whose only cost and charges this Hospital was founded
and endowed with large possessions, for the relief of poor men
and children.&nbsp; He was a gentleman born at Knayth, in the
County of Lincoln, of worthy and honest parentage.&nbsp; He lived
to the age of seventy-nine years, and deceased the 12th day of
December, 1611.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Charter House gardens are exceeding pleasant, and of a
very great extent, considering they stand so far within this
great town.</p>
<p>I shall, in the next place, survey the free schools and
charity schools.</p>
<p>Anciently I have read that there were three principal churches
in London that had each of them a famous school belonging to it;
and these three churches are supposed to be&mdash;(1) The
Cathedral Church of St. Paul, because, at a general council
holden at Rome, anno 1176, it was decreed, &ldquo;That every
cathedral church should have its schoolmaster, to teach poor
scholars and others as had been accustomed, and that no man
should take any reward for licence to teach.&rdquo;&nbsp; (2) The
Abbey Church of St Peter at Westminster; for of the school here
Ingulphus, Abbot of Croyland, in the reign of William the
Conqueror, writes as follows: &ldquo;I, Ingulphus, a humble
servant of God, born of English parents, in the most beautiful
city of London, for attaining to learning was first put to
Westminster, and after to study at Oxford,&rdquo; &amp;c.&nbsp;
(3) The Abbey Church of St. Saviour, at Bermondsey, in Southwark;
for this is supposed to be the most ancient and most considerable
monastery about the city at that time, next to that of St. Peter
at Westminster, though there is no doubt but the convents of St.
John by Clerkenwell, St. Bartholomew in Smithfield, St. Mary
Overy in Southwark, that of the Holy Trinity by Aldgate, and
other monasteries about the city, had their respective schools,
though not in such reputation as the three first.&nbsp; Of these
none are now existing but St. Paul&rsquo;s and Westminster,
though perhaps on different and later foundations.&nbsp; Yet
other schools have been erected in this metropolis from time to
time, amongst which I find that called Merchant Taylors&rsquo; to
be the most considerable.</p>
<p>St. Paul&rsquo;s School is situated on the east side of St.
Paul&rsquo;s Churchyard, being a handsome fabric built with brick
and stone, founded by John Collet, D.D. and Dean of St.
Paul&rsquo;s, anno 1512, who appointed a high-master, sur-master,
a chaplain or under-master, and 153 scholars, to be taught by
them gratis, of any nation or country.&nbsp; He also left some
exhibitions to such scholars as are sent to the universities and
have continued at this school three years.&nbsp; The masters are
elected by the wardens and assistants of the Mercers&rsquo;
Company, and the scholars are admitted by the master upon a
warrant directed to him by the surveyor.&nbsp; The elections for
the university are in March, before Lady Day, and they are
allowed their exhibitions for seven years.&nbsp; To this school
belongs a library, consisting chiefly of classic authors.&nbsp;
The frontispiece is adorned with busts, entablature, pediments,
festoons, shields, vases, and the Mercers&rsquo; arms cut in
stone, with this inscription over the door: <span
class="smcap">Ingredere ut proficias</span>.&nbsp; Upon every
window of the school was written, by the founder&rsquo;s
direction: <span class="smcap">Aut doce</span>, <span
class="smcap">aut disce</span>, <span class="smcap">aut
discede</span>&mdash;<i>i.e.</i>, Either teach, learn, or
begone.</p>
<p>The founder, in the ordinances to be observed in this school,
says he founded it to the honour of the Child Jesus, and of His
blessed mother Mary; and directs that the master be of a
healthful constitution, honest, virtuous, and learned in Greek
and Latin; that he be a married or single man, or a priest that
hath no cure; that his wages should be a mark a week, and a
livery gown of four nobles, with a house in town, and another at
Stebonheath (Stepney); that there should be no play-days granted
but to the King, or some bishop in person: that the scholars
every Childermas Day should go to St. Paul&rsquo;s Church, and
hear the child-bishop sermon, and afterwards at high mass each of
them offer a penny to the child-bishop: and committed the care of
the school to the Company of Mercers; the stipends to the
masters, the officers&rsquo; salaries, &amp;c., belonging to the
school, amounting at first to &pound;118 14s. 7d. 1ob. per annum;
but the rents and revenues of the school being of late years
considerably advanced, the salaries of the masters have been more
than doubled, and many exhibitions granted to those who go to the
university, of &pound;10 and &pound;6 odd money per annum.&nbsp;
The second master hath a handsome house near the school, as well
as the first master.</p>
<p>The school at Mercers&rsquo; Chapel, in Cheapside, hath the
same patrons and governors as that of St. Paul&rsquo;s, viz., the
Mercers, who allow the master a salary of &pound;40 per annum,
and a house, for teaching twenty-five scholars gratis.</p>
<p>Merchant Taylors&rsquo; School is situated near Cannon Street,
on St. Lawrence Poultney (or Pountney) Hill.&nbsp; This school, I
am told, consists of six forms, in which are three hundred lads,
one hundred of whom are taught gratis, another hundred pay two
shillings and sixpence per quarter, and the third hundred five
shillings a quarter; for instructing of whom there is a master
and three ushers: and out of these scholars some are annually, on
St. Barnabas&rsquo; Day, the 11th of June, elected to St.
John&rsquo;s College, in Oxford, where there are forty-six
fellowships belonging to the school.</p>
<p>As to the charity schools: there are in all 131, some for
boys, others for girls; where the children are taught, if boys,
to read, write, and account; if girls, to read, sew, and knit;
who are all clothed and fitted for service or trades gratis.</p>
<p>I proceed in the next place to show how well London is
supplied with water, firing, bread-corn, flesh, fish, beer, wine,
and other provisions.</p>
<p>And as to water, no city was ever better furnished with it,
for every man has a pipe or fountain of good fresh water brought
into his house, for less than twenty shillings a year, unless
brewhouses, and some other great houses and places that require
more water than an ordinary family consumes, and these pay in
proportion to the quantity they spend; many houses have several
pipes laid in, and may have one in every room, if they think fit,
which is a much greater convenience than two or three fountains
in a street, for which some towns in other countries are so much
admired.</p>
<p>These pipes of water are chiefly supplied from the waterworks
at London Bridge, Westminster, Chelsea, and the New River.</p>
<p>Besides the water brought from the Thames and the New River,
there are a great many good springs, pumps, and conduits about
the town, which afford excellent water for drinking.&nbsp; There
are also mineral waters on the side of Islington and Pancras.</p>
<p>This capital also is well supplied with firing, particularly
coals from Newcastle, and pit-coals from Scotland, and other
parts; but wood is excessively dear, and used by nobody for
firing, unless bakers, and some few persons of quality in their
chambers and drawing-rooms.</p>
<p>As for bread-corn, it is for the most part brought to London
after it is converted into flour, and both bread and flour are
extremely reasonable: we here buy as much good white bread for
three-halfpence or twopence, as will serve an Englishman a whole
day, and flour in proportion.&nbsp; Good strong beer also may be
had of the brewer, for about twopence a quart, and of the
alehouses that retail it for threepence a quart.&nbsp; Bear Quay,
below bridge, is a great market for malt, wheat, and horse-corn;
and Queenhithe, above the bridge, for malt, wheat, flour, and
other grain.</p>
<p>The butchers here compute that there are about one thousand
oxen sold in Smithfield Market one week with another the year
round; besides many thousand sheep, hogs, calves, pigs, and
lambs, in this and other parts of the town; and a great variety
of venison, game, and poultry.&nbsp; Fruit, roots, herbs, and
other garden stuff are very cheap and good.</p>
<p>Fish also are plentiful, such as fresh cod, plaice, flounders,
soles, whitings, smelts, sturgeon, oysters, lobsters, crabs,
shrimps, mackerel, and herrings in the season; but it must be
confessed that salmon, turbot, and some other sea-fish are dear,
as well as fresh-water fish.</p>
<p>Wine is imported from foreign countries, and is dear.&nbsp;
The port wine which is usually drunk, and is the cheapest, is two
shillings a quart, retailed in taverns, and not much less than
eighteen or twenty pounds the hogshead, when purchased at the
best hand; and as to French wines, the duties are so high upon
them that they are double the price of the other at least.&nbsp;
White wine is about the same price as red port, and canary about
a third dearer.</p>
<p>It is computed that there are in London some part of the year,
when the nobility and gentry are in town, 15,000 or 16,000 large
horses for draught, used in coaches, carts, or drays, besides
some thousands of saddle-horses; and yet is the town so well
supplied with hay, straw, and corn, that there is seldom any want
of them.&nbsp; Hay generally is not more than forty shillings the
load, and from twenty pence to two shillings the bushel is the
usual price of oats.</p>
<p>The opportunity of passing from one part of the town to the
other, by coach, chair, or boat, is a very great convenience,
especially in the winter, or in very hot weather.&nbsp; A servant
calls a coach or a chair in any of the principal streets, which
attends at a minute&rsquo;s warning, and carries one to any part
of the town, within a mile and a half distance, for a shilling,
but to a chair is paid one-third more; the coaches also will wait
for eighteenpence the first hour, and a shilling every succeeding
hour all day long; or you may hire a coach and a pair of horses
all day, in or out of town, for ten shillings per day; there are
coaches also that go to every village almost about town, within
four or five miles, in which a passenger pays but one shilling,
and in some but sixpence, for his passage with other company.</p>
<p>The pleasantest way of moving from one end of the town to the
other in summer time is by water, on that spacious gentle stream
the Thames, on which you travel two miles for sixpence, if you
have two watermen, and for threepence if you have but one; and to
any village up or down the river you go with company for a
trifle.&nbsp; But the greatest advantage reaped from this noble
river is that it brings whatever this or other countries
afford.&nbsp; Down the river from Oxfordshire, Berkshire, Bucks,
&amp;c., come corn and all manner of provision of English growth,
as has been observed already; and up the river, everything that
the coasts and the maritime counties of England, Scotland, or
Ireland afford; this way also are received the treasures and
merchandise of the East and West Indies, and indeed of the four
quarters of the world.</p>
<p>Carts are hired as coaches, to remove goods and merchandise
from one part of the town to the other, whose rates are also
fixed, and are very reasonable; and for small burdens or parcels,
and to send on messages, there are porters at every corner of the
streets, those within the City of London and liberties thereof
being licensed by authority, and wearing a badge or ticket; in
whose hands goods of any value, and even bills of exchange or
sums of money, may be safely trusted, they being obliged at their
admission to give security.&nbsp; There is also a post that goes
from one part of the town to the other several times a day; and
once a day to the neighbouring villages, with letters and small
parcels; for the carriage of which is given no more than a penny
the letter or parcel.&nbsp; And I should have remembered that
every coach, chair, and boat that plies for hire has its number
upon it; and if the number be taken by any friend or servant, at
the place you set out from, the proprietor of the vehicle will be
obliged to make good any loss or damage that may happen to the
person carried in it, through the default of the people that
carry him, and to make him satisfaction for any abuse or
ill-language he may receive from them.</p>
<p>The high streets from one end of the town to the other are
kept clean by scavengers in the winter, and in summer the dust in
some wide streets is laid by water-carts: they are so wide and
spacious, that several lines of coaches and carts may pass by
each other without interruption.&nbsp; Foot-passengers in the
high streets go about their business with abundance of ease and
pleasure; they walk upon a fine smooth pavement; defended by
posts from the coaches and wheel-carriages; and though they are
jostled sometimes in the throng, yet as this seldom happens out
of design, few are offended at it; the variety of beautiful
objects, animate and inanimate, he meets with in the streets and
shops, inspires the passenger with joy, and makes him slight the
trifling inconvenience of being crowded now and then.&nbsp; The
lights also in the shops till eight or nine in the evening,
especially in those of toymen and pastry-cooks, in the winter,
make the night appear even brighter and more agreeable than the
day itself.</p>
<p>From the lights I come very naturally to speak of the
night-guards or watch.&nbsp; Each watch consists of a constable
and a certain number of watchmen, who have a guard-room or
watch-house in some certain place, from whence watchmen are
despatched every hour, to patrol in the streets and places in
each constable&rsquo;s district; to see if all be safe from fire
and thieves; and as they pass they give the hour of the night,
and with their staves strike at the door of every house.</p>
<p>If they meet with any persons they suspect of ill designs,
quarrelsome people, or lewd women in the streets, they are
empowered to carry them before the constable at his watch-house,
who confines them till morning, when they are brought before a
justice of the peace, who commits them to prison or releases
them, according as the circumstances of the case are.</p>
<p>Mobs and tumults were formerly very terrible in this great
city; not only private men have been insulted and abused, and
their houses demolished, but even the Court and Parliament have
been influenced or awed by them.&nbsp; But there is now seldom
seen a multitude of people assembled, unless it be to attend some
malefactor to his execution, or to pelt a villain in the pillory,
the last of which being an outrage that the Government has ever
seemed to wink at; and it is observed by some that the mob are
pretty just upon these occasions; they seldom falling upon any
but notorious rascals, such as are guilty of perjury, forgery,
scandalous practices, or keeping of low houses, and these with
rotten eggs, apples, and turnips, they frequently maul
unmercifully, unless the offender has money enough to bribe the
constables and officers to protect him.</p>
<p>The London inns, though they are as commodious for the most
part as those we meet with in other places, yet few people choose
to take up their quarters in them for any long time; for, if
their business requires them to make any stay in London, they
choose to leave their horses at the inn or some livery-stable,
and take lodgings in a private house.&nbsp; At livery stables
they lodge no travellers, only take care of their horses, which
fare better here than usually at inns; and at these places it is
that gentlemen hire saddle-horses for a journey.&nbsp; At the
best of them are found very good horses and furniture: they will
let out a good horse for 4s. a day, and an ordinary hackney for
2s. 6d., and for 5s. you may have a hunter for the city hounds
have the liberty of hunting; in Enfield Chase and round the town,
and go out constantly every week in the season, followed by a
great many young gentlemen and tradesmen.&nbsp; They have an
opportunity also of hunting with the King&rsquo;s hounds at
Richmond and Windsor: and such exercises seem very necessary for
people who are constantly in London, and eat and drink as
plentifully as any people in the world.&nbsp; And now I am
speaking of hired horses, I cannot avoid taking notice of the
vast number of coach-horses that are kept to be let out to
noblemen or gentlemen, to carry or bring them to and from the
distant parts of the kingdom, or to supply the undertakers of
funerals with horses for their coaches and hearses.&nbsp; There
are some of these men that keep several hundreds of horses, with
coaches, coachmen, and a complete equipage, that will be ready at
a day&rsquo;s warning to attend a gentleman to any part of
England.&nbsp; These people also are great jockeys.&nbsp; They go
to all the fairs in the country and buy up horses, with which
they furnish most of the nobility and gentry about town.&nbsp;
And if a nobleman does not care to run any hazard, or have the
trouble of keeping horses in town, they will agree to furnish him
with a set all the year round.</p>
<p>The principal taverns are large handsome edifices, made as
commodious for the entertaining a variety of company as can be
contrived, with some spacious rooms for the accommodation of
numerous assemblies.&nbsp; Here a stranger may be furnished with
wines, and excellent food of all kinds, dressed after the best
manner:&mdash;each company, and every particular man, if he
pleases, has a room to himself, and a good fire if it be winter
time, for which he pays nothing, and is not to be disturbed or
turned out of his room by any other man of what quality soever,
till he thinks fit to leave it.&nbsp; And as many people meet
here upon business, at least an equal-number resort hither purely
for pleasure, or to refresh themselves in an evening after a
day&rsquo;s fatigue.</p>
<p>And though the taverns are very numerous, yet ale-houses are
much more so, being visited by the inferior tradesmen, mechanics,
journeymen, porters, coachmen, carmen, servants, and others whose
pockets will not reach a glass of wine.&nbsp; Here they sit
promiscuously in common dirty rooms, with large fires, and clouds
of tobacco, where one that is not used to them can scarce breathe
or see; but as they are a busy sort of people, they seldom stay
long, returning to their several employments, and are succeeded
by fresh sets of the same rank of men, at their leisure hours,
all day long.</p>
<p>Of eating-houses and cook-shops there are not many,
considering the largeness of the town, unless it be about the
Inns of Court and Chancery, Smithfield, and the Royal Exchange,
and some other places, to which the country-people and strangers
resort when they come to town.&nbsp; Here is good butcher&rsquo;s
meat of all kinds, and in the best of them fowls, pigs, geese,
&amp;c., the last of which are pretty dear; but one that can make
a meal of butcher&rsquo;s meat, may have as much as he cares to
eat for sixpence; he must be content indeed to sit in a public
room, and use the same linen that forty people have done before
him.&nbsp; Besides meat, he finds very good white bread,
table-beer, &amp;c.</p>
<p>Coffee-houses are almost as numerous as ale-houses, dispersed
in every part of the town, where they sell tea, coffee,
chocolate, drams, and in many of the great ones arrack and other
punch, wine, &amp;c.&nbsp; These consist chiefly of one large
common room, with good fires in winter; and hither the middle
sort of people chiefly resort, many to breakfast, read the news,
and talk politics; after which they retire home: others, who are
strangers in town, meet here about noon, and appoint some tavern
to dine at; and a great many attend at the coffee-houses near the
Exchange, the Inns of Court, and Westminster, about their
business.&nbsp; In the afternoon about four, people resort to
these places again, from whence they adjourn to the tavern, the
play, &amp;c.; and some, when they have taken a handsome dose,
run to the coffee-house at midnight for a dish of coffee to set
them right; while others conclude the day here with drams, or a
bowl of punch.</p>
<p>There are but few cider-houses about London, though this be
liquor of English growth, because it is generally thought too
cold for the climate, and to elevate the spirits less than wine
or strong beer.</p>
<p>The four grand distinctions of the people are these:&mdash;(1)
The nobility and gentry; (2) the merchants and first-rate
tradesmen; (3) the lawyers and physicians; and (4) inferior
tradesmen, attorneys, clerks, apprentices, coachmen, carmen,
chairmen, watermen, porters, and servants.</p>
<p>The first class may not only be divided into nobility and
gentry, but into either such as have dependence on the Court, or
such as have none.&nbsp; Those who have offices, places, or
pensions from the Court, or any expectations from thence,
constantly attend the lev&eacute;es of the prince and his
ministers, which takes up the greatest part of the little morning
they have.&nbsp; At noon most of the nobility, and such gentlemen
as are members of the House of Commons, go down to Westminster,
and when the Houses do not sit late, return home to dinner.&nbsp;
Others that are not members of either House, and have no
particular business to attend, are found in the chocolate-houses
near the Court, or in the park, and many more do not stir from
their houses till after dinner.&nbsp; As to the ladies, who
seldom rise till about noon, the first part of their time is
spent, after the duties of the closet, either at the tea-table or
in dressing, unless they take a turn to Covent Garden or Ludgate
Hill, and tumble over the mercers&rsquo; rich silks, or view some
India or China trifle, some prohibited manufacture, or foreign
lace.</p>
<p>Thus, the business of the day being despatched before dinner,
both by the ladies and gentlemen, the evening is devoted to
pleasure; all the world get abroad in their gayest equipage
between four and five in the evening, some bound to the play,
others to the opera, the assembly, the masquerade, or
music-meeting, to which they move in such crowds that their
coaches can scarce pass the streets.</p>
<p>The merchants and tradesmen of the first-rate make no mean
figure in London; they have many of them houses equal to those of
the nobility, with great gates and courtyards before them, and
seats in the country, whither they retire the latter end of the
week, returning to the city again on Mondays or Tuesdays; they
keep their coaches, saddle-horses, and footmen; their houses are
richly and beautifully furnished; and though their equipage be
not altogether so shining and their servants so numerous as those
of the nobility, they generally abound in wealth and plenty, and
are generally masters of a larger cash than they have occasion to
make use of in the way of trade, whereby they are always provided
against accidents, and are enabled to make an advantageous
purchase when it offers.&nbsp; And in this they differ from the
merchants of other countries, that they know when they have
enough, for they retire to their estates, and enjoy the fruits of
their labours in the decline of life, reserving only business
enough to divert their leisure hours.&nbsp; They become gentlemen
and magistrates in the counties where their estates lie, and as
they are frequently the younger brothers of good families, it is
not uncommon to see them purchase those estates that the eldest
branches of their respective families have been obliged to part
with.</p>
<p>Their character is that they are neither so much in haste as
the French to grow rich, nor so niggardly as the Dutch to save;
that their houses are richly furnished, and their tables well
served.&nbsp; You are neither soothed nor soured by the merchants
of London; they seldom ask too much, and foreigners buy of them
as cheap as others.&nbsp; They are punctual in their payments,
generous and charitable, very obliging, and not too ceremonious;
easy of access, ready to communicate their knowledge of the
respective countries they traffic with, and the condition of
their trade.</p>
<p>As to their way of life, they usually rise some hours before
the gentlemen at the other end of the town, and having paid their
devotions to Heaven, seldom fail in a morning of surveying the
condition of their accounts, and giving their orders to their
bookkeepers and agents for the management of their respective
trades; after which, being dressed in a modest garb, without any
footmen or attendants, they go about their business to the Custom
House, Bank, Exchange, &amp;c., and after dinner sometimes apply
themselves to business again; but the morning is much the busiest
part of the day.&nbsp; In the evening of every other day the post
comes in, when the perusing their letters may employ part of
their time, as the answering them does on other days of the week;
and they frequently meet at the tavern in the evening, either to
transact their affairs, or to take a cheerful glass after the
business of the day is over.</p>
<p>As to the wives and daughters of the merchants and principal
tradesmen, they endeavour to imitate the Court ladies in their
dress, and follow much the same diversions; and it is not
uncommon to see a nobleman match with a citizen&rsquo;s daughter,
by which she gains a title, and he discharges the incumbrances on
his estate with her fortune.&nbsp; Merchants&rsquo; sons are
sometimes initiated into the same business their fathers follow;
but if they find an estate gotten to their hands, many of them
choose rather to become country gentlemen.</p>
<p>As to the lawyers or barristers, these also are frequently the
younger sons of good families; and the elder brother too is
sometimes entered of the Inns of Court, that he may know enough
of the law to keep his estate.</p>
<p>A lawyer of parts and good elocution seldom fails of rising to
preferment, and acquiring an estate even while he is a young
man.&nbsp; I do not know any profession in London where a person
makes his fortune so soon as in the law, if he be an eminent
pleader.&nbsp; Several of them have of late years been advanced
to the peerage; as Finch, Somers, Cowper, Harcourt, Trevor,
Parker, Lechmere, King, Raymond, &amp;c., scarce any of them much
exceeding forty years of age when they arrived at that
honour.</p>
<p>The fees are so great, and their business so engrosses every
minute of their time, that it is impossible their expenses should
equal their income; but it must be confessed they labour very
hard, are forced to be up early and late, and to try their
constitutions to the utmost (I mean those in full business) in
the service of their clients.&nbsp; They rise in winter long
before it is light, to read over their briefs; dress, and prepare
themselves for the business of the day; at eight or nine they go
to Westminster, where they attend and plead either in the Courts
of Equity or Common Law, ordinarily till one or two, and (upon a
great trial) sometimes till the evening.&nbsp; By that time they
have got home, and dined, they have other briefs to peruse, and
they are to attend the hearings, either at the Lord
Chancellor&rsquo;s or the Rolls, till eight or nine in the
evening; after which, when they return to their chambers, they
are attended by their clients, and have their several cases and
briefs to read over and consider that evening, or the next
morning before daylight; insomuch that they have scarce time for
their meals, or their natural rest, particularly at the latter
end of a term.&nbsp; They are not always in this hurry; indeed,
if they were, the best constitution must soon be worn out; nor
would anyone submit to such hardships who had a subsistence, but
with a prospect of acquiring a great estate suddenly; for the
gold comes tumbling into the pockets of these great lawyers,
which makes them refuse no cause, how intricate or doubtful
soever.&nbsp; And this brings me to consider the high fees that
are usually taken by an eminent counsel; as for a single opinion
upon a case, two, three, four, and five guineas; upon a hearing,
five or ten; and perhaps a great many more; and if the cause does
not come on till the next day, they are all to be fee&rsquo;d
again, though there are not less than six or seven counsel of a
side.</p>
<p>The next considerable profession therefore I shall mention in
London is that of the physicians, who are not so numerous as the
former; but those who are eminent amongst them acquire estates
equal to the lawyers, though they seldom arrive at the like
honours.&nbsp; It is a useful observation, indeed, as to English
physicians, that they seldom get their bread till they have no
teeth to eat it: though, when they have acquired a reputation,
they are as much followed as the great lawyers; they take care,
however, not to be so much fatigued.&nbsp; You find them at
Batson&rsquo;s or Child&rsquo;s Coffee House usually in the
morning, and they visit their patients in the afternoon.&nbsp;
Those that are men of figure amongst them will not rise out of
their beds or break their rest on every call.&nbsp; The greatest
fatigue they undergo is the going up forty or fifty pair of
stairs every day; for the patient is generally laid pretty near
the garret, that he may not be disturbed.</p>
<p>These physicians are allowed to be men of skill in their
profession, and well versed in other parts of learning.&nbsp; The
great grievance here (as in the law) is that the inferior people
are undone by the exorbitance of their fees; and what is still a
greater hardship is, that if a physician has been employed, he
must be continued, however unable the patient is to bear the
expense, as no apothecary may administer anything to the sick
man, if he has been prescribed to first by a physician: so that
the patient is reduced to this dilemma, either to die of the
disease, or starve his family, if his sickness happens to be of
any duration.&nbsp; A physician here scorns to touch any other
metal but gold, and the surgeons are still more unreasonable; and
this may be one reason why the people of this city have so often
recourse to quacks, for they are cheap and easily come at, and
the mob are not judges of their ability; they pretend to great
things; they have cured princes, and persons of the first
quality, as they pretend; and it must be confessed their patients
are as credulous as they can desire, taken with grand pretences,
and the assurance of the impostor, and frequently like things the
better that are offered them out of the common road.</p>
<p>I come in the next place to treat of attorneys&rsquo; clerks,
apprentices, inferior tradesmen, coachmen, porters, servants, and
the lowest class of men in this town, which are far the most
numerous: and first of the lawyers&rsquo; clerks and apprentices,
I find it a general complaint that they are under no manner of
government; before their times are half out, they set up for
gentlemen; they dress, they drink, they game, frequent the
playhouses, and intrigue with the women; and it is no uncommon
thing with clerks to bully their masters, and desert their
service for whole days and nights whenever they see fit.</p>
<p>As to the ordinary tradesmen, they live by buying and selling;
I cannot say they are so eminent for their probity as the
merchants and tradesmen of the first rate; they seem to have a
wrong bias given them in their education; many of them have no
principles of honour, no other rule to go by than the fishmonger,
namely, to get what they can, who consider only the weakness or
ignorance of the customer, and make their demands accordingly,
taking sometimes half the price they ask.&nbsp; And I must not
forget the numbers of poor creatures who live and maintain their
families by buying provisions in one part of the town, and
retailing them in another, whose stock perhaps does not amount to
more than forty or fifty shillings, and part of this they take up
(many of them) on their clothes at a pawnbroker&rsquo;s on a
Monday morning, which they make shift to redeem on a Saturday
night, that they may appear in a proper habit at their
parish-churches on a Sunday.&nbsp; These are the people that cry
fish, fruit, herbs, roots, news, &amp;c, about town.</p>
<p>As to hackney-coachmen, carmen, porters, chairmen, and
watermen, though they work hard, they generally eat and drink
well, and are decently clothed on holidays; for the wife, if she
be industrious, either by her needle, washing, or other business
proper to her sex, makes no small addition to their gains; and by
their united labours they maintain their families handsomely if
they have their healths.</p>
<p>As to the common menial servants, they have great wages, are
well kept and clothed, but are, notwithstanding the plague, of
almost every house in town.&nbsp; They form themselves into
societies, or rather confederacies, contributing to the
maintenance of each other when out of place; and if any of them
cannot manage the family where they are entertained as they
please, immediately they give notice they will be gone.&nbsp;
There is no speaking to them; they are above correction; and if a
master should attempt it, he may expect to be handsomely drubbed
by the creature he feeds and harbours, or perhaps an action
brought against him for it.&nbsp; It is become a common saying,
&ldquo;If my servant ben&rsquo;t a thief, if he be but honest, I
can bear with other things;&rdquo; and indeed it is very rare in
London to meet with an honest servant.</p>
<p>When I was treating of tradesmen, I had forgot to mention
those nuisances of the town, the itinerant pedlars who deal in
toys and hardware, and those who pretend to sell foreign silks,
linen, India handkerchiefs, and other prohibited and unaccustomed
goods.&nbsp; These we meet at every coffee-house and corner of
the streets, and they visit also every private house; the women
have such a gust for everything that is foreign or prohibited,
that these vermin meet with a good reception everywhere.&nbsp;
The ladies will rather buy home manufactures of these people than
of a neighbouring shopkeeper, under the pretence of buying
cheaper, though they frequently buy damaged goods, and pay a
great deal dearer for them than they would do in a
tradesman&rsquo;s shop, which is a great discouragement to the
fair dealer that maintains a family, and is forced to give a
large credit, while these people run away with the ready
money.&nbsp; And I am informed that some needy tradesmen employ
fellows to run hawking about the streets with their goods, and
sell pennyworths, in order to furnish themselves with a little
money.</p>
<p>As to the recreations of the citizens, many of them are
entertained in the same manner as the quality are, resorting to
the play, park, music-meetings, &amp;c.; and in the summer they
visit Richmond, Hampstead, Epsom, and other neighbouring towns,
where horse-racing, and all manner of rural sports, as well as
other diversions, are followed in the summer season.</p>
<p>Towards autumn, when the town is thin, many of the citizens
who deal in a wholesale way visit the distant parts of the
kingdom to get in their debts, or procure orders for fresh
parcels of goods; and much about the same time the lawyers are
either employed in the several circuits, or retired to their
country seats; so that the Court, the nobility and gentry, the
lawyers, and many of the citizens being gone into the country,
the town resumes another face.&nbsp; The west end of it appears
perfectly deserted; in other parts their trade falls off; but
still in the streets about the Royal Exchange we seldom fail to
meet with crowds of people, and an air of business in the hottest
season.</p>
<p>I have heard it affirmed, however, that many citizens live
beyond their income, which puts them upon tricking and
prevaricating in their dealings, and is the principal occasion of
those frequent bankruptcies seen in the papers; ordinary
tradesmen drink as much wine, and eat as well, as gentlemen of
estates; their cloth, their lace, their linen, are as fine, and
they change it as often; and they frequently imitate the quality
in their expensive pleasures.</p>
<p>As to the diversions of the inferior tradesmen and common
people on Sundays and other holidays, they frequently get out of
town; the neighbouring villas are full of them, and the
public-houses there usually provide a dinner in expectation of
their city guests; but if they do not visit them in a morning,
they seldom fail of walking out in the fields in the afternoon;
every walk, every public garden and path near the town are
crowded with the common people, and no place more than the park;
for which reason I presume the quality are seldom seen there on a
Sunday, though the meanest of them are so well dressed at these
times that nobody need be ashamed of their company on that
account; for you will see every apprentice, every porter, and
cobbler, in as good cloth and linen as their betters; and it must
be a very poor woman that has not a suit of Mantua silk, or
something equal to it, to appear abroad in on holidays.</p>
<p>And now, if we survey these several inhabitants in one body,
it will be found that there are about a million of souls in the
whole town, of whom there may be 150,000 men and upwards capable
of bearing arms, that is, between eighteen and sixty.</p>
<p>If it be demanded what proportion that part of the town
properly called the City of London bears to the rest, I answer
that, according to the last calculations, there are in the city
12,000 houses; in the parishes without the walls, 36,320; in the
parishes of Middlesex and Surrey, which make part of the town,
46,300; and in the city and liberties of Westminster, 28,330; in
which are included the precincts of the Tower, Norton Folgate,
the Rolls, Whitefriars, the Inns of Court and Chancery, the
King&rsquo;s palaces, and all other extra-parochial places.</p>
<p>As to the number of inhabitants in each of these four grand
divisions, if we multiply the number of houses in the City of
London by eight and a half, there must be 102,000 people there,
according to this estimate.&nbsp; By the same rule, there must be
308,720 people in the seventeen parishes without the walls;
393,550 in the twenty-one out-parishes of Middlesex and Surrey;
and 240,805 in the city and liberties of Westminster, all which
compose the sum-total of 1,045,075 people.</p>
<p>Let me now proceed to inquire into the state of the several
great trading companies in London.&nbsp; The first, in point of
time, I find to be the Hamburg Company, originally styled
&ldquo;Merchants of the Staple&rdquo; (that is, of the staple of
wool), and afterwards Merchant Adventurers.&nbsp; They were first
incorporated in the reign of King Edward I., anno 1296, and
obtained leave of John, Duke of Brabant, to make Antwerp their
staple or mart for the Low Countries, where the woollen
manufactures then flourished more than in any country in
Europe.&nbsp; The business of this company at first seems to be
chiefly, if not altogether, the vending of English wool
unwrought.</p>
<p>Queen Elizabeth enlarged the trade of the Company of
Adventurers, and empowered them to treat with the princes and
states of Germany for a place which might be the staple or mart
for the woollen manufactures they exported, which was at length
fixed at Hamburg, from whence they obtained the name of the
Hamburg Company.&nbsp; They had another mart or staple also
assigned them for the sale of their woollen cloths in the Low
Countries, viz., Dort, in Holland.</p>
<p>This company consists of a governor, deputy-governor, and
fellowship, or court of assistants, elected annually in June, who
have a power of making bye-laws for the regulation of their
trade; but this trade in a manner lies open, every merchant
trading thither on his own bottom, on paying an inconsiderable
sum to the company; so that though the trade to Germany may be of
consequence, yet the Hamburg Company, as a company, have very
little advantage by their being incorporated.</p>
<p>The Hamburg or German Merchants export from England
broad-cloth, druggets, long-ells, serges, and several sorts of
stuffs, tobacco, sugar, ginger, East India goods, tin, lead, and
several other commodities, the consumption of which is in Lower
Germany.</p>
<p>England takes from them prodigious quantities of linen,
linen-yarn, kid-skins, tin-plates, and a great many other
commodities.</p>
<p>The next company established was that of the Russia Merchants,
incorporated 1st and 2nd of Philip and Mary, who were empowered
to trade to all lands, ports, and places in the dominions of the
Emperor of Russia, and to all other lands not then discovered or
frequented, lying on the north, north-east, or north-west.</p>
<p>The Russia Company, as a company, are not a very considerable
body at present; the trade thither being carried on by private
merchants, who are admitted into this trade on payment of five
pounds for that privilege.</p>
<p>It consists of a governor, four consuls, and twenty-four
assistants, annually chosen on the 1st of March.</p>
<p>The Russia Merchants export from England some coarse cloth,
long-ells, worsted stuffs, tin, lead, tobacco, and a few other
commodities.</p>
<p>England takes from Russia hemp, flax, linen cloth, linen yarn,
Russia leather, tallow, furs, iron, potashes, &amp;c., to an
immense value.</p>
<p>The next company is the Eastland Company, formerly called
Merchants of Elbing, a town in Polish Prussia, to the eastward of
Dantzic, being the port they principally resorted to in the
infancy of their trade.&nbsp; They were incorporated 21
Elizabeth, and empowered to trade to all countries within the
Sound, Norway, Sweden, Poland, Liefland, Prussia, and Pomerania,
from the river Oder eastward, viz., with Riga, Revel,
K&ouml;nigsberg, Elbing, Dantzic, Copenhagen, Elsinore, Finland,
Gothland, Eastland, and Bornholm (except Narva, which was then
the only Russian port in the Baltic).&nbsp; And by the said
patent the Eastland Company and Hamburg Company were each of them
authorised to trade separately to Mecklenburg, Gothland, Silesia,
Moravia, Lubeck, Wismar, Restock, and the whole river Oder.</p>
<p>This company consists of a governor, deputy-governor, and
twenty-four assistants, elected annually in October; but either
they have no power to exclude others from trading within their
limits, or the fine for permission is so inconsiderable, that it
can never hinder any merchants trading thither who is inclined to
it; and, in fact, this trade, like the former, is carried on by
private merchants, and the trade to Norway and Sweden is laid
open by Act of Parliament.</p>
<p>To Norway and Denmark merchants send guineas, crown-pieces,
bullion, a little tobacco, and a few coarse woollens.</p>
<p>They import from Norway, &amp;c., vast quantities of deal
boards, timber, spars, and iron.</p>
<p>Sweden takes from England gold and silver, and but a small
quantity of the manufactures and production of England.</p>
<p>England imports from Sweden near two-thirds of the iron
wrought up or consumed in the kingdom, copper, boards, plank,
&amp;c.</p>
<p>The Turkey or Levant Company was first incorporated in the
reign of Queen Elizabeth, and their privileges were confirmed and
enlarged in the reign of King James I., being empowered to trade
to the Levant, or eastern part of the Mediterranean, particularly
to Smyrna, Aleppo, Constantinople, Cyprus, Grand Cairo,
Alexandria, &amp;c.&nbsp; It consists of a governor,
deputy-governor, and eighteen assistants or directors, chosen
annually, &amp;c.&nbsp; This trade is open also to every merchant
paying a small consideration, and carried on accordingly by
private men.</p>
<p>These merchants export to Turkey chiefly broadcloth,
long-ells, tins, lead, and some iron; and the English merchants
frequently buy up French and Lisbon sugars and transport thither,
as well as bullion from Cadiz.</p>
<p>The commodities received from thence are chiefly raw silk,
grogram yarn, dyeing stuffs of sundry kinds, drugs, soap;
leather, cotton, and some fruit, oil, &amp;c.</p>
<p>The East India Company were incorporated about the 42nd of
Elizabeth, anno 1600, and empowered to trade to all countries to
the eastward of the Cape of Good Hope, exclusive of all
others.</p>
<p>About the middle of King William&rsquo;s reign it was
generally said their patent was illegal, and that the Crown could
not restrain the English merchants from trading to any country
they were disposed to deal with; and application being made to
Parliament for leave to lay the trade open, the ministry took the
hint, and procured an Act of Parliament (9 and 10 William III.,
cap. 44) empowering every subject of England to trade to India
who should raise a sum of money for the supply of the Government
in proportion to the sum he should advance, and each subscriber
was to have an annuity after the rate of 8 per cent. per annum,
to commence from Michaelmas, 1698.&nbsp; And his Majesty was
empowered to incorporate the subscribers, as he afterwards did,
and they were usually called the New East India Company, the old
company being allowed a certain time to withdraw their
effects.&nbsp; But the old company being masters of all the towns
and forts belonging to the English on the coast of India, and
their members having subscribed such considerable sums towards
the two millions intended to be raised, that they could not be
excluded from the trade, the new company found it necessary to
unite with the old company, and to trade with one joint stock,
and have ever since been styled &ldquo;The United Company of
Merchants trading to the East Indies.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The company have a governor, deputy-governor, and twenty-four
assistants or directors, elected annually in April.</p>
<p>The East India Company export great quantities of bullion,
lead, English cloth, and some other goods, the product or
manufacture of that kingdom, and import from China and India tea,
china ware, cabinets, raw and wrought silks, coffee, muslins,
calicoes, and other goods.</p>
<p>Bengal raw silk is bought at very low prices there, and is
very useful in carrying on the manufactures of this kingdom.</p>
<p>China silk is of excellent staple, and comes at little above
one-third of the price of Italian Piedmont silk.</p>
<p>The China silk is purchased at Canton, but their fine silk is
made in the provinces of Nankin and Chekiam, where their fine
manufactures are carried on, and where prodigious quantities of
raw silk are made, and the best in all China.</p>
<p>The Royal African Company was incorporated 14 Charles II., and
empowered to trade from Sallee, in South Barbary, to the Cape of
Good Hope, being all the western coast of Africa.&nbsp; It
carries no money out, and not only supplies the English
plantations with servants, but brings in a great deal of bullion
for those that are sold to the Spanish West Indies, besides gold
dust and other commodities, as red wood, elephants&rsquo; teeth,
Guinea grain, &amp;c., some of which are re-exported.&nbsp; The
supplying the plantations with negroes is of that extraordinary
advantage, that the planting sugar and tobacco and carrying on
trade there could not be supported without them; which
plantations are the great causes of the increase of the riches of
the kingdom.</p>
<p>The Canary Company was incorporated in the reign of King
Charles II., anno 1664, being empowered to trade to the Seven
Islands, anciently called the Fortunate, and now the Canary
Islands.</p>
<p>They have a governor, deputy-governor, and thirteen assistants
or directors, chosen annually in March.&nbsp; This company
exports baize, kerseys, serges, Norwich stuffs, and other woollen
manufactures; stockings, hats, fustians, haberdashery wares, tin,
and hardware; as also herrings, pilchards, salted flesh, and
grain; linens, pipe-staves, hoops, &amp;c.&nbsp; Importing in
return Canary wines, logwood, hides, indigo, cochineal, and other
commodities, the produce of America and the West Indies.</p>
<p>There is another company I had almost overlooked, called the
Hudson&rsquo;s Bay Company; and though these merchants make but
little noise, I find it is a very advantageous trade.&nbsp; They
by charter trade, exclusively of all other his Britannic
Majesty&rsquo;s subjects, to the north-west; which was granted,
as I have been told, on account that they should attempt a
passage by those seas to China, &amp;c., though nothing appears
now to be less their regard; nay; if all be true, they are the
very people that discourage and impede all attempts made by
others for the opening that passage to the South Seas.&nbsp; They
export some woollen goods and haberdashery wares, knives,
hatchets, arms, and other hardware; and in return bring back
chiefly beaver-skins, and other skins and furs.</p>
<p>The last, and once the most considerable of all the trading
companies, is that of the South Sea, established by Act of
Parliament in the ninth year of the late Queen Anne; but, what by
reason of the mismanagement of its directors in 1720, the
miscarriage of their whale-fishery, and the intrigues of the
Spaniards, their credit is sunk, and their trade has much
decreased.</p>
<p>I proceed, in the next place, to inquire what countries the
merchants of London trade to separately, not being incorporated
or subject to the control of any company.</p>
<p>Among which is the trade to Italy, whither are exported
broad-cloth, long-ells, baize, druggets, callimancoes, camlets,
and divers other stuffs; leather, tin, lead, great quantities of
fish, as pilchards, herrings, salmon, Newfoundland cod, &amp;c.,
pepper, and other East India goods.</p>
<p>The commodities England takes from them are raw, thrown, and
wrought silk, wine, oil, soap, olives, some dyer&rsquo;s wares,
anchovies, &amp;c.</p>
<p>To Spain the merchants export broad-cloth, druggets,
callimancoes, baize, stuff of divers kinds, leather, fish, tin,
lead, corn, &amp;c.</p>
<p>The commodities England takes from them are wine, oil, fruit
of divers kinds, wool, indigo, cochineal, and dyeing stuffs.</p>
<p>To Portugal also are exported broad-cloth, druggets, baize,
long-ells, callimancoes, and all other sorts of stuffs; as well
as tin, lead, leather, fish, corn, and other English
commodities.</p>
<p>England takes from them great quantities of wine, oil, salt,
and fruit, and gold, both in bullion and specie; though it is
forfeited, if seized in the ports of Portugal.</p>
<p>The French take very little from England in a fair way,
dealing chiefly with owlers, or those that clandestinely export
wool and fuller&rsquo;s-earth, &amp;c.&nbsp; They indeed buy some
of our tobacco, sugar, tin, lead, coals, a few stuffs, serges,
flannels, and a small matter of broad-cloth.</p>
<p>England takes from France wine, brandy, linen, lace, fine
cambrics, and cambric lawns, to a prodigious value; brocades,
velvets, and many other rich silk manufactures, which are either
run, or come by way of Holland; the humour of some of the
nobility and gentry being such, that although they have those
manufactures made as good at home, if not better than abroad, yet
they are forced to be called by the name of French to make them
sell.&nbsp; Their linens are run in very great quantities, as are
their wine and brandy, from the Land&rsquo;s End even to the
Downs.</p>
<p>To Flanders are exported serges, a few flannels, a very few
stuffs, sugar, tobacco, tin, and lead.</p>
<p>England takes from them fine lace, fine cambrics, and
cambric-lawns, Flanders whited linens, threads, tapes, incles,
and divers other commodities, to a very great value.</p>
<p>To Holland the merchants export broad-cloth, druggets,
long-ells, stuffs of a great many sorts, leather, corn, coals,
and something of almost every kind that this kingdom produces;
besides all sorts of India and Turkey re-exported goods, sugars,
tobacco, rice, ginger, pitch and tar, and sundry other
commodities of the produce of our American plantations.</p>
<p>England takes from Holland great quantities of fine Holland
linen, threads, tapes, and incles; whale fins, brass battery,
madder, argol, with a large number of other commodities and toys;
clapboard, wainscot, &amp;c.</p>
<p>To Ireland are exported fine broad-cloth, rich silks, ribbons,
gold and silver lace, manufactured iron and cutlery wares,
pewter, great quantities of hops, coals, dyeing wares, tobacco,
sugar, East India goods, raw silk, hollands, and almost
everything they use, but linens, coarse woollens, and
eatables.</p>
<p>England takes from Ireland woollen yarn, linen yarn, great
quantities of wool in the fleece, and some tallow.</p>
<p>They have an extraordinary trade for their hides, tallow;
beef, butter, &amp;c., to Holland, Flanders, France, Portugal,
and Spain, which enables them to make large remittances.</p>
<p>To the sugar plantations are exported all sorts of clothing,
both linen, silks, and woollen; wrought iron, brass, copper, all
sorts of household furniture, and a great part of their food.</p>
<p>They return sugar, ginger, and several commodities, and all
the bullion and gold they can meet with, but rarely carry out
any.</p>
<p>To the tobacco plantations are exported clothing, household
goods, iron manufactures of all sorts, saddles, bridles, brass
and copper wares; and notwithstanding they dwell among the woods,
they take their very turnery wares, and almost everything else
that may be called the manufacture of England.</p>
<p>England takes from them not only what tobacco is consumed at
home, but very great quantities for re-exportation.</p>
<p>To Carolina are exported the same commodities as to the
tobacco plantations.&nbsp; This country lying between the 32nd
and 36th degrees of northern latitude, the soil is generally
fertile.&nbsp; The rice it produces is said to be the best in the
world; and no country affords better silk than has been brought
from thence, though for want of sufficient encouragement the
quantity imported is very small.&nbsp; It is said both bohea and
green tea have been raised there, extraordinary good of the
kind.&nbsp; The olive-tree grows wild, and thrives very well, and
might soon be improved so far as to supply us with large
quantities of oil.&nbsp; It is said the fly from whence the
cochineal is made is found very common, and if care was taken
very great quantities might be made.&nbsp; The indigo plant grows
exceedingly well.&nbsp; The country has plenty of iron mines in
it, and would produce excellent hemp and flax, if encouragement
was given for raising it.</p>
<p>To Pennsylvania are exported broad-cloth, kerseys, druggets,
serges, and manufactures of all kinds.</p>
<p>To New England are exported all sorts of woollen manufactures,
linen, sail-cloth and cordage for rigging their ships,
haberdashery, &amp;c.&nbsp; They carry lumber and provisions to
the sugar plantations; and exchange provisions for logwood with
the logwood-cutters at Campeachy.&nbsp; They send pipe and
barrel-staves and fish to Spain, Portugal, and the Straits.&nbsp;
They send pitch, tar, and turpentine to England, with some
skins.</p>
<p>Having considered the trading companies, and other branches of
foreign trade, I shall now inquire into the establishment of the
Bank of England.</p>
<p>The governor and company of the Bank of England, &amp;c., are
enjoined not to trade, or suffer any person in trust for them to
trade, with any of the stock, moneys or effects, in the buying or
selling of any merchandise or goods whatsoever, on pain of
forfeiting the treble value.&nbsp; Yet they may deal in bills of
exchange, and in buying and selling of bullion, gold or silver,
or in selling goods mortgaged to them, and not redeemed at the
time agreed on, or within three months after, or such goods as
should be the produce of lands purchased by the
corporation.&nbsp; All bills obligatory and of credit under the
seal of the corporation made to any person, may by endorsement be
assigned, and such assignment shall transfer the property to the
moneys due upon the same, and the assignee may sue in his own
name.</p>

<p>Give me leave to observe here, that most of the foreign trade
of this town is transacted by brokers, of which there are three
sorts, viz., 1st, Exchange-brokers, 2ndly, brokers for goods and
merchandise, and 3rdly, ship-brokers.</p>
<p>The exchange-brokers, who are versed in the course of
exchange, furnish the merchant with money or bills, as he has
occasion for either.</p>
<p>The broker of goods lets the merchant know where he may
furnish himself with them, and the settled price; or if he wants
to sell, where he may meet with a chapman for his effects.</p>
<p>The ship-broker finds ships for the merchant, when he wants to
send his goods abroad; or goods for captains and masters of
vessels to freight their ships with.</p>
<p>If it be demanded what share of foreign trade London hath with
respect to the rest of the kingdom; it seems to have a fourth
part of the whole, at least if we may judge by the produce of the
customs, which are as three to twelve, or thereabouts.</p>
<p>As to the manufactures carried on in the City of London; here
mechanics have acquired a great deal of reputation in the world,
and in many things not without reason; for they excel in clock
and cabinet-work, in making saddles, and all sorts of tools, and
other things.&nbsp; The door and gun locks, and fire-arms, are
nowhere to be paralleled; the silk manufacture is equal to that
of France, or any other country, and is prodigiously enlarged of
late years.&nbsp; Dyers also are very numerous in and about
London, and are not exceeded by any foreigners in the beauty or
durableness of their colours: and those that print and stain
cottons and linens have brought that art to great
perfection.&nbsp; Printers of books, also, may equal those
abroad; but the best paper is imported from other countries.</p>
<p>The manufacture of glass here is equal to that of Venice, or
any other country in Europe, whether we regard the coach or
looking-glasses, perspective, drinking-glasses, or any other kind
of glass, whatever.&nbsp; The making of pins and needles is
another great manufacture in this town, as is that of
wire-drawings of silver, gold, and other metals.&nbsp; The
goldsmiths and silversmiths excel in their way.&nbsp; The
pewterers and brasiers furnish all manner of vessels and
implements for the kitchen, which are as neatly and substantially
made and furnished here as in any country in Europe.&nbsp; The
trades of hat-making and shoe-making employ multitudes of
mechanics; and the tailors are equally numerous.&nbsp; The
cabinet, screen, and chair-makers contribute also considerably to
the adorning and furnishing the dwelling-house.&nbsp; The common
smiths, bricklayers, and carpenters are no inconsiderable branch
of mechanics; as may well be imagined in a town of this
magnitude, where so many churches, palaces, and private buildings
are continually repairing, and so many more daily erecting upon
new foundations.&nbsp; And this brings me to mention the
shipwrights, who are employed in the east part of the town, on
both sides the river Thames, in building ships, lighters, boats,
and other vessels; and the coopers, who make all the casks for
domestic and foreign service.&nbsp; The anchorsmiths, ropemakers,
and others employed in the rigging and fitting out ships, are
very numerous; and brewing and distilling may be introduced among
the manufactures of this town, where so many thousand quarters of
malt are annually converted into beer and spirits: and as the
various kinds of beer brewed here are not to be paralleled in the
world, either for quantity or quality, so the distilling of
spirits is brought to such perfection that the best of them are
not easily to be distinguished from French brandy.</p>
<p>Having already mentioned ship-building among the mechanic
trades, give me leave to observe farther, that in this England
excels all other nations; the men-of-war are the most beautiful
as well as formidable machines that ever floated on the
ocean.</p>
<p>As to the number of foreigners in and about this great city,
there cannot be given any certain account, only this you may
depend upon, that there are more of the French nation than of any
other: such numbers of them coming over about the time of the
Revolution and since to avoid the persecution of Louis XIV., and
so many more to get their bread, either in the way of trade, or
in the service of persons of quality; and I find they have
upwards of twenty churches in this town, to each of which, if we
allow 1,000 souls, then their number must be at least
20,000.&nbsp; Next to the French nation I account most of the
Dutch and Germans; for there are but few Spaniards or Portuguese,
and the latter are generally Jews; and except the raree-show men,
we see scarce any of the natives of Italy here; though the
Venetian and some other Italian princes have their public chapels
here for the exercise of the Romish religion.</p>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
